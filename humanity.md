The Humanity score represents how close a Kindred remains to their human
nature, to specific people vital to them, and how easily they slip away
from human concerns and instead towards the whims of the
<a href="beast" class="wikilink" title="Beast">Beast</a>.

## Overview

Most vampires will begin to drop in Humanity over time with neonates and
ancillas sitting around Humanity 5.[1] A vampire player character will
start at Humanity 7 unless particular circumstances alter this such as
<a href="predator_types" class="wikilink"
title="Predator types">Predator types</a>. Those that are freshly
<a href="Embrace" class="wikilink" title="Embraced">Embraced</a> will
begin at Humanity 8. Kindred are monsters, regardless of their rating
and even the most saintly and highest of Humanity vampires can be
morally corrupt. As their Humanity rating changes over the course of
time, it's important to keep track of the changes that will occur. As
their rating deteriorates over time, their connections alter and soon
they might find themselves holding the corpse of a human they had
originally never intended to kill.[2]

## The Humanity Track

![A Humanity 7 character's
tracker](Humanity_7_tracker.png "A Humanity 7 character's tracker") The
Humanity tracker contains 10 spaces, with the Humanity rating filled
from left to right.

### Stains

Stains are what damage Humanity and are caused by significant actions.
Those actions may include embracing a new childe, harming a touchstone,
breaching their own convictions or the chronicle tenets. Tenet Stains
can be negated by a character's
<a href="Conviction" class="wikilink" title="Conviction">Conviction</a>
if it was broken in alignment of their Conviction, reducing the amount
of Stains gained by one or more. The amount of Stains earned can vary
from clear violations giving only 1 and with truly monstrous or
egregious breaks netting 2 or more. Fill the amount of Stains exceeds
the amount of empty spaces in the tracker *degeneration* is
triggered.[3] ![A Humanity 7 character's tracker with two
Stains](Humanity_7_tracker_2_stains.png "A Humanity 7 character's tracker with two Stains")
When taking Stains, the tracker fills in from right to left with slash
marks to differentiate the Stains from Humanity.

### Remorse

When a character has Stains in their tracker at the end of a session
they will make a Remorse test. The Remorse pool is composed of how many
empty spaces are left between the Humanity and the amount of Stains
taken. In the case of a Humanity 7 character with only one Stain, they'd
roll two dice. However, in cases where there are no spaces left, such as
a Humanity 7 character with three Stains, they'd still roll 1 die. Any
amount of successes means that the character has felt enough guilt,
shame and remorse than their Humanity will not drop. If they do not any
successes, the beast has won and they must drop 1 Humanity. Once the
remorse test is completed, all Stains are removed.[4]

### Degeneration

In cases where they have taken more Stains than they have room for, the
character becomes *impaired*. This type of impairment removes two dice
from all possible pools as they are racked with regret. In addition to
this, they take one point of Aggravated
<a href="Willpower" class="wikilink" title="Willpower">Willpower</a>
damage for each Stain that did not fit onto the tracker. During this
time, the character is unable of further intentional Tenet violations
and upon being forced to commit one must test for a terror
<a href="frenzy" class="wikilink" title="frenzy">frenzy</a> with
Difficulty 4. This impairment will remain until they test for Remorse at
the end of the session, alternatively they may choose to snap out of it
by automatically dropping by one Humanity point and removing all
Stains.[5]

rarer.

  their changes noted in each section below.

  vomit.[11]
