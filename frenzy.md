## Overview

A Frenzy is a moment the Beast takes control, an experience where all
rational thought and reasoning disappear as they are driven solely by
rage, hunger, or fear. During this moment, a vampire will do whatever it
takes to reach their end goal, be it draining someone they loved dry or
tearing them to shreds. Unlike the other quirks of the Blood, a Frenzy
is never subtle. To resist a Frenzy, a vampire must make a
<a href="Willpower" class="wikilink" title="Willpower">Willpower</a>
test against a difficulty set by the
<a href="Storyteller" class="wikilink"
title="Storyteller">Storyteller</a>. This pool is composed of their
unspent Willpower and 1/3 of their
<a href="Humanity" class="wikilink" title="Humanity">Humanity</a>
rounded down. Should they succeed in this test, they will spend a turn
suppressing these impulses unless it is a critical success, whereupon
they resist without losing their turn. Upon failure, the Storyteller
will generally take control of the character till it passes. This roll
does not allow for the use of
<a href="Blood_Surge" class="wikilink" title="Blood Surge">Blood
Surge</a> or Willpower to reroll failures and does not include Hunger.

## Ride the Wave

If a character decides to give into the Beast, rather than make the
test. The Storyteller should allow the player to play out this Frenzy
themselves, while still abiding by the rules of the Frenzy itself, such
as allowing them to decide who they feed upon first.

## Effects of a Frenzy

- They remain in a Frenzy until the requirements of the type of Frenzy
  are met.

## Types of Frenzies

- **Fury Frenzy** - Caused by insults, humiliation, or aggressive risks
  towards those they care for. They will not stop till they destroy the
  object or person who caused this Frenzy and succeed in a Willpower
  test with the Difficulty varied depending on if enemies are still in
  the room. If they fail, they will continue to destroy everyone and
  everything in the room unless subdued.
- **Hunger Frenzy** - Whenever they fail a
  <a href="Rouse_Check" class="wikilink" title="Rouse Check">Rouse
  Check</a> at
  <a href="Hunger_system" class="wikilink" title="Hunger">Hunger</a> 5,
  the vampire must make a Willpower test for Frenzy. In addition to
  this, the Storyteller can add in other times when a Hunger Frenzy
  might trigger such as drinking blood or smelling it at Hunger 4.
  During this time, they will do anything they can to find a fresh
  source of blood and will do so violently till they reach Hunger 1 or
  below.
- **Terror Frenzy** - Also known as RÃ¶tschreck, it appears in moments of
  true danger, the Beast will attempt to take control and preserve
  itself from threats. In general, this manifests from sunlight or fire,
  but grave damage can also cause this. During this, they will flee from
  the scene no matter who or what is in their way and will keep running
  till they can no longer perceive the threat.[1]
