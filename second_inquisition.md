## Who are the Second Inquisition

<section begin=summary/>

The Second Inquisition is not a single entity, but an event. A movement
creating an era where risking the
<a href="Masquerade" class="wikilink" title="Masquerade">Masquerade</a>
comes at a cost and shapes Kindred to fear kine once more. What most
Kindred mean by the phrase *Second Inquisition* is the covert
multinational conspiracy that contains multiple intelligence services
and other groups including the Vatican that are actively hunting down
the undead, though this does not mean they are controlled by their
respective agencies.

## Overview

The Second Inquisition is a long feared event when too many humans peek
behind the Masquerade. Second Inquisition is the name Kindred have given
these new age witch-hunters, they are a loose confederation of
intelligence agencies. Those under the name FIRSTLIGHT, are the US
branch including agents from the CIA, NSA, and more. These agencies are
usually disguised as anti-terrorism to fool lower ranking agents and the
public of their activities. Their hesitation to make their secret war
public is due to Kindred pawns interfering and a possible pushback from
the public.[2]

This new inquisition has weapons and tactics that have allowed them to
burn many havens. Airports are now unsafe for Kindred, witnesses can be
deadly, and messages sent via phone or text need to be careful not to
contain any Masquerade breaching terms. Those that don't take
precautions in this new era may end up a list or worse. While the
importance of the Masquerade was proven vital. Kindred fears are met
with these humans, Kindred are outnumbered by humanity. Oddly enough
this may provide younger Kindred with means to move up in Kindred
society in an opportunistic way. So many have died, there is a chance
for a new Kindred to take their place. [3]

The reaction has been all over the spectrum in Kindred society. The
factions have had different responses to this, the
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md) are
more guarded with technology, encouraging members to use old forms of
spycraft,
[animalism](./animalism.md),
ciphers, etc. Some Princes even outright ban online presence. The Tower
has essentially retreated to their old ways and wish to keep their
chance of discover small in this new age, hoping to repeat how they
defeat the First Inquisition. The
[Anarchs](./anarch.md) are not as
shy about tech using their know how to avoid detection with burner
phones,
[dominated](./dominate.md)
humans,
[fleshcrafted](./protean.md)
body doubles, throw in with hackers, etc. Some
[Thin-bloods](./thinblood.md) can simply hide in plain sight or
even corroborate with the SI.[4]

## History

Kindred have had the occasional pawn or crossed path with intelligence
agencies, usually fleeing rogue agents. The Masquerade made the notion
of the living dead ridiculous which served Kindred well, but after the
War on Terror things changed. The
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md)
took a gamble, throwing the
[Sabbat](./sabbat.md) to the
intelligence agencies which wrecked havoc on the Cainites. As these
agents did their work they started to find more Kindred evidence,
impossibly old bank accounts and questionable records were discovered.
Also the NSA was freed of most traditional restrictions allowed even
more surveillance. As the hunted heated up the Tower threw the
[Anarchs](./anarch.md) to the
wolves, but the flame of the Inquisition was already lit.[5]

The Information Awareness Office (IAO) was founded by Admiral John
Poindexter in 2002. The intention was to pinpoint any threats to the
USA. The program used investigations and advanced economic algorithms to
find anomalies; Camarilla accounts and high profile contacts. A result
of their attempt to manipulate the War on Terror.[6] This resulted in
ghouls,
[dominated](./dominate.md)
thralls, and even Kindred captured and each were extracted for
information. The Camarilla was able to defund the IAO officially by
2003, by manipulating public opinion on human rights, but it was too
late. [7] 

Admiral Roberto Farrier, Poindexter’s handpicked successor, simply
obfuscated the IAO activities under normal Pentagon black budget
counterterrorism activities. Without Congress or Pentagon oversight this
shadow IAO could run with Farrier at the helm, from his office in Pearl
Harbor. He now can direct programs to anti-kindred activities, disguised
as anti-terrorism programs. This proves a double edged sword, he can
manipulate the defense department, but the resources he pulls needs to
fit plausible operations.&lt;ref name="CAM69-70/&gt;

Soon the Second Inquisition got a great gift in the freeing of Felicity
Price, Associate Director of the NSA. She was a dominated thrall of a
[Nosferatu](./nosferatu.md),
Xóchitl. This gave the SI first-hand information on the Nosferatu and
some knowledge into the Camarilla structure, clan structures, and a good
chunk of the Camarilla network. Price has been instrumental in the
formation of FIRSTLIGHT. She reaches out to international partners to
join the coalition and share information.[8]

The Second Inquisition cracked SchreckNET, Kindred internet overseen by
[Nosferatu](./nosferatu.md),
which ignited the flames of the Second Inquisition once humans had
access to so much Kindred information. Using shell organizations and
secrecy they are able to operate without scrutiny from the public and
governing bodies.[9][10]

FIRSTLIGHT began to work with others like Russia’s GRU and the Vatican’s
Service, the Entity, providing vital records from old Inquisition tales.
Loose agents in these organization were able to ban together and
accomplish major feats; 2008 saw the destruction of the
[Tremere](./tremere.md) Chantry
in Vienna, and 2013 is the date London was marked as Kindred free with
the supposed death of Queen Anne, Prince of London. France had Marseille
cleared by the DGSE forcing François Villon into hiding. Black sites are
said to have held a number of captured Kindred. They have some major
defeats too, such as the Detroit Hunt of 2012, a disastrous raid where a
supposed turncoat Kindred betrayed the Coalition and freed others. This
lead to the death of many field agents.[11][12]

In the opening acts of this new inquisition the Camarilla has taken
heavy blows with London and Vienna, but many Sabbat and Anarch havens
have been hit the hardest. These events even factor into the Giovanni
inclination to form the
[Hecata](./hecata.md).[13] The
[Banu Haqim](./banu.md)
and
[Ministry](./ministry.md)
are finding being independent clans not as advantageous with domains
between the Gehenna War and Second Inquisition.[14]

## Organizations

The Second Inquisition may seem like a FIRSTLIGHT agent bursting into a
Kindred's haven in the day time decked out in tactical gear, but it can
take many forms. The major government conspiracy raging a secret war is
The Coalition. The alliance of agents and hidden uses of assets fund the
deadly raids Kindred have learned to fear in this new age. Eyes on
technology and algorithms Kindred are tasked with adapting or being
burned out. But the Second Inquisition has more than men in black and
special agents, it has individual hunters, conspiracy theorist, and even
gang members in this movement. The larger conspiracy from the Coalition
are the major concern of most Kindred, but the small homegrown hunters
can prove just as deadly for Kindred new to the night. [15][16]

### The Coalition

This is what the Five Torches, the second-party, and third-party hunters
call their overall conspiracy. It may be acronyms, code names, or
whatever means they need to use to obfuscate their dealings. They can
hide their information gathering and exchange at mundane and
inconvenient locations while a more flashy event is happening like
various summits or world conferences. A double edged sword with their
effectiveness sharpened, but national interest and personal politics
still rearing its ugly head. IAO, FIRSTLIGHT, and Vatican’s La Entità
are major players keeping this conspiracy in line with limitless funds,
information network, and mastery of mystical defenses, respectively.[17]

The main body of the Coalition is comprised of the Five Torches, but
they also ally with secondary partners in other countries. The max
number of seats at the table for planning Coalition wide strategy are
only ten or less. Though many countries oversee their own domestic
tactics when able to.[18]

#### The Five Torches

The five most influential countries with intelligence that have the
information, focus, and funding for fighting a war on Kindred. The Five
Torches are joined with other countries who have begun to put resources
into the Second Inquisition.[19]

Though Five Torches are resource rich, they may not all have the best
interest at heart, often being just as corrupt as the Kindred they face.
FIRSTLIGHT and JTRG use their resources to eliminate political enemies
and forward their national interest.[20] PMEX in South America recruits
human traffickers as well as terrorists to fight Kindred.[21] The
growing mistrust of FIRSTLIGHT's agenda or GRU constant espionage
against allies is a constant thorn in the Coalition.&lt;ref
name="SI126-127&gt;<a href="Vampire:_The_Masquerade_Second_Inquisition" class="wikilink"
title="Vampire: The Masquerade Second Inquisition">Vampire: The
Masquerade Second Inquisition</a>, pages 126-127

</ref>

[22] The Vatican encourages government corruption to easier bribe
officials so they can expand operations.[23] Individual Farm Team
hunters deemed a liability The Coalition is not above tipping off
Kindred to deal with them. Better the nuisance hunters die to Kindred
than endanger the Coalition's operations.[24]

##### United States

Seeing Kindred as a threat to national security with Blood Bonds and
mental domination of high ranking officials, they attempt to thoroughly
attack the threat. While they seem cohesive to outsiders, the US has
fractures in its agencies as competition for funding and jurisdiction
are always up for grabs.[25]

- **Information Awareness Office** - Also known as IAO, headed by
  Admiral Roberto Farrier in Pearl Harbor. This agency leads strikes and
  conducts US military operations or calls on private contractors. All
  of its dealings are classified or falsely mislabeled to misdirect the
  public and Kindred. They are also the purse of the Coalition,
  funneling US government money for operations while they find ways to
  justify the cost. [26]&lt;ref name="CAM69-70/&gt;
- **FIRSTLIGHT** - Headed by Associate Director Felicity Price,
  originally an organization in the CIA and NSA, the FIRSTLIGHT now
  touches many security agencies. It takes in information and either
  passes the targets to IAO, SAD or other agencies to strike, to have
  deniability. In special cases it sends in its own strike force for
  high value targets. Recruits [Thin-bloods](./thinblood.md) with promises of revenge and cures
  only to send them to experimentation sites. [27][28]
- **FBI’s Special Affairs Division** - Also called SAD, headed by Deputy
  Director Marcus Questor. Originally formed by J. Edgar Hoover fought
  against the Giovanni and later Capone, investigating UFOs and Bigfoot.
  It fell out of favor for years upon his death. [29] Seen as a career
  ending department for decades to follow as the FIRSTLIGHT and IAO
  began, SAD uses its influence in law enforcement and extensive case
  files for anti-Kindred activities. Usually using finesse and detective
  work to get their targets. They have a large collection of mystical
  artifacts they are reluctant to share. Commandeered Kindred assets
  give them enough economic freedom from IAO.[30]

##### United Kingdom

The US may have more say in how the global conspiracy works, the UK with
the clearing of London has given their branch prestige. Called the
Newburg Group, as an informal like minded group of high ranking
officials. This is spread headed by Sir Simon Newburgh. Scotland Yard
and the mysterious order, the Arcanum, who have documented the
supernatural also aid in these efforts.[31] Plans to expand the model to
other cities are planned, but the UK’s recent political climate has made
international cooperation complex.[32] They still manage to trade
information with the US. They seek to expand partnership to Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand. SO13 is unwanted to many other organizations
in the Coalition for its tactics.[33]

- **Joint Threat Response Group** - Also called JTRG, directed by Sir
  Simon Newburgh. This group works as the information gathering portion
  of the UK and European effort with biometrics, Xscopes, and facial
  recognition technology. While their data mining leaves much to be
  desired, JTRG specializes in audio and visual surveillance. Faces 2
  issues, hiding the fact all Kindred in London are technically dead
  which threatens their clout, and European nations are not too keen to
  have a wide-range British surveillance program in their home turf.
  [34][35]
- **Specialist Operations Branch 13** - Also called SO13 headed by Ishaq
  Khan. Officially SO13 merged with SO12 to make the counterterrorism
  unit SO15 to the British public. In actuality, SO13 remained an
  independent unit. Filled with SAS commandos and Royal marines and
  protected by GCHQ. They were the unit to destroy havens in London, and
  supposedly beheaded Queen Anne in 2012. Overly zealous wishing to also
  put Thin-bloods, herd members, and ghouls to the flame as well. Using
  face masks and decapitations as scare tactics and their extreme views
  have made others the Coalition reluctant to expand such agents into
  the rest of Europe. [36][37]
- **The Arcanum** - Made up of occult
  <a href="Magician" class="wikilink" title="sorcerers">sorcerers</a>,
  scholars, and hobbyists, as well as even some members of England’s
  elite. The Vatican and SAD have more occult resources than they, but
  what they lack in artifacts they make up with in organization. Their
  sorcerous knowledge aided in the downfall of Vienna. Specialist in
  ritual magic and knowledge of the arcane. Unknown to the others UK
  organizations, while the Arcanum can divine locations and thwart
  wards, Kindred magic is still leagues ahead of them.[38]

##### Russia

The [Brujah](./brujah.md) used to
have a tight grip on Russia’s KGB and information organizations. The GRU
Fifth Directorate was formed to isolate influences by the KGB which
discovered the Anarchs and Brujah pulling the strings. They started
their fight against Kindred in the 1970s. Joining the Inquisition in
2004, they had enjoyed stake-wielding Spetsnaz with stakes. In 2009,
their leader resigned and their funding was cut in a massive blow to
them. They kept their operation essential, usually only striking out
against high value targets.[39] Even so they had been fighting 3 decades
before the other organizations, so they are territorial in its
jurisdiction, especially to UK and US agencies.[40]

- **GRU Eighth Direction** - Called GRU-N58 or GRU for short. They
  consider themselves the more successful organization hunting blank
  bodies. Having used the time since their founding to secretly take out
  influential Kindred. While FIRSTLIGHT and SO13 prefer overwhelming
  force and brutality, GRU sees such as wasteful preferring a surgical
  approach with fully briefed agents. They specialize in false flag
  operations playing up Kindred faction warfare. They have a distrust of
  FIRSTLIGHT. GRU is always cautious about sharing resources with the
  agency, thinking their large information stores are a bigger threat
  than Kindred.[41]
- **Unit 242 Special Purposes** - Called U242, they covers the occult
  aspects and even recruits foreign contractors. This is to have
  deniability and write off any caught or captured as radical agents.
  Their units have vampires and supernaturals in their rank from GRU
  compromised communities. Soldiers that show promise are taken to
  mysterious and dangerous training and pass through ZMEI protocols to
  get Kindred-like powers with benefits and no drawbacks. Though they
  will develop more traditional Kindred weakness, they seldom live long
  enough.&lt;ref name="SI126-127/&gt;
- **The Akritai** - An order originally from the times of
  Constantinople. The order tries to present itself to be an independent
  witch-hunting organization it in essence falls under GRU, unbeknownst
  to the members. They act as spies for GRU into the Vatican and
  manpower for operations. Many believe they still have mystical powers,
  in truth they use mostly combat skill and modern weapons, the true
  sorcerers are kept heavily guarded by GRU and restricted from leaving
  Russian soil save for special circumstances.[42]

##### Brazil

Brazil’s agencies are close allies to the Vatican, and also have years
of experience fighting supernatural forces. Due to
[Lasombra](./lasombra.md) and
[Toreador](./toreador.md)
warring over dominance, they were ignored and rather used by Princes as
tools to attack their enemies. This allowed them to gain more experience
and funds from plundered Kindred assets. The Vatican brought them fully
into the Second Inquisition. [43] Though they are reluctant to expand
outside South America, others of the Coalition often overlook their
experience in fighting supernatural forces.[44]

- **BOES** - Special Secret Operations Battalion or Batalhão de
  Operações Especiais Secretas (BOES) is composed of different units in
  Brazil’s Special Police Operations Battalions (SPOB) from all over the
  country handpicking squads to dedicate in vampire hunting. BOES main
  goal is to keep kindred influence from oil refineries, political
  offices, and military bases. They do on occasion fight Kindred in
  cities and favelas, having experience in “block-by-block” methods. The
  Vatican provides them with artifacts, SAD with support, and IAO
  funding has allowed BOES to expand to places like Bogotá, Caracas, and
  Luanda.[45] Though SPOB have territory issues and rivalry with
  commandos dying of odd circumstances linked to organized crime. Hiding
  the effects of their government corruption and fear of FIRSTLIGHT
  overreach are two pressing issues for the BOES in The Coalition. [46]
- **Military Police Extraterritorial Operations** - Called PMEX, Formed
  at the behest of the Vatican with IAO funding. PMEX trains local
  forces in ways of vampire hunters in the wider South America. Working
  outside Brazil this group is composed of militias and insurgents that
  have lost people to Kindred. They are supplied with incendiary
  landmines as well as trained in staking and decapitation, PMEX still
  finds itself at a disadvantage relying on incendiary and mystical
  weakness still struggling against motivated hostile Kindred. The
  people trained for PMEX are all stripes: terrorist, insurgents,
  militias, war criminals, human traffickers, etc. This fact causes
  friction with FIRSTLIGHT and GRU, but PMEX refuses to argue
  morals.[47]

##### The Vatican

The heart of the Coalition and most fervent. They are the foremost in
knowledge of fighting Kindred with over 800 years of research. Composed
of the Entity, their intelligence wing, and Society of St. Leopold, the
latter of which was founded in 1231 by Leopold of Murnau and Pope
Gregory IX. The Masquerade at one point convinced the Vatican the
Kindred threat was ridiculous and severed ties with the Society. Now it
has returned full force. In 1998, Ingrid Bauer began a crusade against
Kindred. When The IAO and NSA began to form FIRSTLIGHT, Bauer began to
make alliances with the US-based agencies. With the Entità and Society
combined again the Vatican is a formidable force against
Kindred.[48][49]

- **La Entità** - Also called The Entity, the Inner workings is a
  mystery, supposedly led by 9 high ranking church officials. It works
  as the intelligence and decision making arm of the Vatican. Keeps the
  Holy See from direct involvement. Acknowledging the political
  corruption and misaimed first of the First Inquisition, they strive to
  burn out all Kindred this time. The Entity prefers to overlook their
  own operations, only giving advisors to other operations save for
  Brazil operations. To them, all others of the Coalition are expendable
  since they are the most important part. This is why Gladius Dei was
  created to have Vatican presence without the core being in any real
  trouble. [50] Their ESOG and Gladius Dei teams operate with IAO or
  BOES in mission when a large force is needed, but their use in muddied
  war zones where Kindred presence is questioned has become a concern to
  The Entity. They are suspicious of US agencies using them as political
  tools and GRU information leaked confirms this.[51]
- **Gladius Dei/Entity Special Operations Group -** Abbreviated ESOG for
  short. Gladius Dei serves as the secret master of the Entity, but
  contradictory subordinate to the Society of St. Leopold. Not all ESOG
  are Gladius Dei and not all Gladius Dei are in ESOG. A confusing
  structure, but the Vatican uses this to their fullest potential. The
  Entity recruit from Catholic militaries for young recruits to Gladius
  Dei. Those with supernatural talent are then turned over to ESOG. ESOG
  has access to unique weapons and items, decked out in tactical gear,
  they are the most used to military structure and tactics. Gladius
  Dei/ESOG got up against active Kindred threats at night unlike the
  rest of the Coalition who conducted day strikes based on intelligence
  reports.[52]
- **Society of St. Leopold** - No longer a loose confederation of lone
  hunters, they are now more organized in their vampire hunting. The
  birth of suborders have helped with organizations and closer bonds
  with the Entity. They still freelance when on Coalition business or as
  advisors. But when working in their Society squads they have adopted
  modern tactics. Each suborder has tactics, but usually work in a team
  of six. Lightly equipped with powerful artifacts and even operating
  with Sorcerers.[53] Their zeal for their missions can be twisted by
  Kindred or blinded by darker human impulses, and has proven their own
  failing in the past. They have fooled themselves into learning from
  the First Inquisition, but abuse of power and manipulative machination
  are prevalent still, just as much as they are Kindred society. They
  also are corruptors bending other in seats of power to their will.[54]
  - Suborders: Each suborder has tactics, but usually work in a team of
    six. Lightly equipped with powerful artifacts and even operating
    with Sorcerers. Many more exist with varying ideology and
    techniques. Some even focus on more than just Kindred. Below are
    those involved in the Second Inquisition.[55]
    - Children of Lazarus - Founded after the French Revolution and
      based in Paris, this suborder employs the harshest hunting tactics
      and considers Kindred blasphemy. Their methods make them only used
      as foot soldiers for ESOG. They mainly operate in North America
      and Europe, but has other safe houses.[56]
    - Humble Bother of San Rocco - A Venice-based suborder. Many hunters
      also seek to care for the poor and sick as well as Vampire
      hunting. Involved in city restorations and excellent knowledge of
      urban layouts, this allowed them to survive Kindred attacks in
      cities. [57] The corruption of the Society is slowly turning the
      suborder to more fanatical destructive tactics of the city it once
      protected.[58]
    - Sisters of St. Sebastian - Based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This
      suborder is small but has rare powers of precognitive visions at
      the cost of their health. The most potent seers suffer horrific
      injury from using their potent foresight. Usually overlooked by
      ESOG due to sexist bias in recruiting, though exceptions are made
      with powerful seers as they are inhumanly fortified mentally and
      against pain.[59]
    - Order of San Carlo - One of the oldest suborders, tracing their
      founding to the Spanish Inquisition and based in Seville.
      Originally founded as a power grab with plundered riches over
      actual witch hunting, today they are more in line with the Second
      Inquisition and one of the riche suborders. They have excellent
      trained units and prefer daytime raids or incendiary devices. [60]
    - Order of Sao Paulo - One of the largest suborders based in the
      Brazilian city, São Paulo. Their recruits are found in BOES
      veterans and locals. With sober corporate culture and link between
      BOES and The Entity, the Church in turns allows them the most
      powerful artifacts. They are decked out with heavy tactical armor,
      riot shields, and blades during operations. They prove prime picks
      for ESOG. [61]
    - Friars of Tavelic - Also known as the cult of Friars, this small
      order is based in Zagreb, Croatia and operates all over Eastern
      Europe. They hold martyrdom on high to a troubling degree, so much
      so the ESOG finds their self-destructive nature a liability. They
      have close ties with the Russian Akritai and work as links between
      them and the Entity.[62]

#### Partner Organizations

Not part of the Five Torches, but part of the Coalition, several
countries have their own tactics for dealing with Kindred. They may
partner with Coalition resources of course, but they each have their own
Agenda and interest.[63]

- Egypt: Homeland Special Program - The HSP infiltrates Kindred cults in
  North Africa and Europe, focusing on human intelligence. They use
  blackmail and coercion against Kindred cultists. The actual capture of
  the Kindred is left up to IAO.[64]
- France: La Calcédoine - Guided by France’s DGSE intelligence analyst
  system, Emeraude, La Calcédoine are a group of specialists often. They
  are often attached to official operations when the operation is
  thought to have Kindred influence. They succeeded in clearing
  Marseilles and forcing <a href="Francois_Villon" class="wikilink"
  title="Francois Villon">Francois Villon</a> into hiding. They believe
  Kindred is part of a greater conspiracy called *la menace secréte*.
  They specialize in capture and interrogation, they are pushing for an
  open war with Kindred as they have caught hints of a powerful ancient
  Kindred rising. They operate in France, Mali, Niger, Gabon, and Côte
  d’Ivoire.[65][66]
- Israel: Unit 8211 - Unit 8211 excels at cracking complex information
  systems and works without bureaucracy and legal hassles. They can hack
  into delivered Kindred devices in the day time or even tract the
  movement of Elders in the Gehenna War. [67][68]
- Japan: Third Intelligence Department - Called TID for short, Kindred
  overpopulation turned a once relatively safe place that came to an end
  upon the death of the Tokyo’s Prince. With no official sanction or
  oversight their agents err on the side of overly enthusiastic. Small
  in size and depending on IAO and FIRSTLIGHT for resources, they still
  prove effective.[69]
- Poland: Bureau IX - Thought to be founded in 2002, it’s roots go back
  to the WWII era. Opposed to leftist groups and Russian influence. The
  Coalition offers a chance for Poland’s national interest and
  strengthens ties to the Vatican. Jaded with democratic rule, they plan
  for a government coup to push their radical agenda. They willingly
  plan night raids and deploy untested technology against kindred.[70]
- Sweden: G-Kontoret - Dedicated to the Coalition since the early days
  of the Second Inquisition and founded by Arcanum members, G-K
  specializes in economic espionage. They distrust SO13, but work with
  JTRG and the Newburgh Group. Unbeknownst to the rest of the Coalition,
  G-K researches a cure for vampirism. Thin-bloods have been guinea pigs
  for their occult studies with some success in reducing kindred
  drawbacks. They rely on FIRSTLIGHT and Russian Akritai for new
  Kindred.[71]

### Farm Teams

These groups are sometimes called “Farm Teams” as a play on words for
them being minor leagues. Not all organizations are part of the grand
conspiracy like the Coalition or Five Torches. Some are more contained
at lower levels of operation. Vampire hunting is just using weapons and
finding out who is Kindred and who is not. They can be gangsters ready
to strike back at a Kindred for their vigilante work to an online
community posting about strange sightings.

To older Kindred enemies like cops, criminals, theorists, and solo
hunters are easy fodder, but to fledgling and young neonates who lack
power and connections, they can be major roadblocks or even formidable
foes. Some of which can even seen induction into the Coalition.[72]

#### Law Enforcement

From the local police departments to Europol or FBI agents, any that
investigate violent crimes may stumble into the world of Kindred. They
lack information or military-grade weapons, usually, but their
determination, intimate knowledge of their city, and personal
connections can give them a serious edge to an out-of-town neonate.

A major obstacle for law enforcement is police gear differs depending on
location and they have to justify their weapon usage to their superiors,
especially to firepower to hurt Kindred. They can however make hunting
grounds hard to access, contacts less willing to break the law, and even
hurt one's standing with the Camarilla or kine business relationships
with heighten cop attention. It is imperative a Kindred, coterie, or
retainers disrupt or distract the police while they are investigating.
Given enough time they can uncover connections to associates and coterie
mates, or worse perform a daytime raid.

Killing them causes more problems or higher level agents may appear, but
hiding behind mortals is viable. Bribery or even going after their
problem cases can turn them into assets.[73]

#### Organized Crime

Russian Bratva, Mafia, street gangs, cartels, and the like are unique in
the fact a character can find them as enemies even if the criminal
syndicate is ignorant of their status as Kindred. These groups are
territorial and hate sharing the exploitation of the vulnerable in the
city. Some select groups may not even be amoral gangsters, but community
criminal protectors who see Kindred as monster or blasphemy to God.

Given they do not know or care if an enemy is Kindred, what they do care
about is when a Kindred disrupts their operations: a
[Puttanesca's](./hecata.md) crew rivals their gang,
[Thin-bloods](./thinblood.md) deal on their block, supernaturally
strong [Brujah](./brujah.md)
vigilantes, or even
[Ventrue](./ventrue.md)
manipulating local politicians to hurt their rackets. Their bottom line
and dominance is usually all they care about. They are wily antagonists,
manipulating finances, blackmailing herds, and getting hands on high
grade weapons via black market. Worst yet they can be as ruthless and
amoral as Kindred deeming firebombing, drive-by shootings, and
kidnappings fair game.

They have money and people but neither are limitless, a Kindred can
bleed them out figuratively. Violence works well as a few dead will be
overlooked by law enforcement or even blow back on the gang as the
police try to stop a “gang war” from progressing.[74]

#### Conspiracy Theorists

Not a single person, a group of people with fringe ideas who think that
maybe Vampires aren’t just fiction, but actually walk the earth. They
congregate on forums and websites with like-minded theorists safe from
the skeptics where they can look over, swap their evidence and maul over
urban legends.

The power of the internet at work with some having access to special
databases. This works as they usually never plan to physically confront
a vampire, though some can get access to an assault rifle in a pinch.
This biggest boon is remaining unseen and sending the SWAT to a haven,
giving often ignored leads to intelligence agencies, and alerting other
farm teams of Kindred presences. This can prove to be a hidden conflict
Kindred suffers with if they aren’t tech savvy or have the investigation
skills for.

Dealing with them is tough as bad tips quickly burn an account’s
reliability and they generally distrust throwaway accounts. Best action
may be to lay low for a while. Cunning Kindred can set the police on
them by planting illegal guns, drugs, or bombing making items, if they
can find out who these people are.[75]

#### Amateurs

The classic solo Van Helsings many think of when they hear the words
vampire hunter. They aren’t as looming a threat as the other farm team
members, but can be annoying with their ferocity. These hunters can be
made of desperate people looking, avenge a dead lover, or paranoid
individuals wanting the drainings to stop. They can even be a moral
dilemma to more empathic Kindred who need to consider their convictions.
To others it is a chance to flex powers on weak opponents. Their
equipment is never the best, but may wield True Faith or artifacts,
which can make them actual threats.

They complicate things, such as it not really self-defense if they never
proved a threat. They can go after touchstones or the much weaker,
vulnerable childe. If [Thin-bloods](./thinblood.md) are important to a Kindred they may
attack them on the streets with larger margins of success. They can even
turn into accidental serial killers who make hunting harder. Some attack
in public unafraid of arrest banking on Kindred holding back.

These Hunters may appear at inopportune times and make life difficult,
but can be dealt with. Fed them a target to chase, direct them to a
Kindred rival, send them to a human enemy, or even ghoul and Blood Bond
useful ones.[76]

## Second Inquisition in Chronicles

### Tactics

Before they resort to tearing down havens and firing on sleeping
Kindred, the members of the Coalition had certain tactics they employed.
Even cells of farm teams may adapt these tactics. Usually they attack on
multifront social, mental, physical, and occult means. Their teams use a
mix of these skills to corner Kindred then eliminate them.[77]

Social agents can challenge Kindred in halls of power or worse make life
harder for Kindred with little clout or political savviness. Blackmail,
traitorous blood dolls, informants, etc. make up their ranks.[78]

Mental agents lay the groundwork for raids and attacks. High levels like
the FIve Torches are able to use algorithms and tap into numerous
databases to track Kindred. Others still rely on old fashion
investigation skills, hackers, and stalkers. [79]  

Physical agents are more straightforward in their skills. It can be a
well trained military-clad IAO agent or a farm team gangbanger ready to
bust some kneecaps. While soldiers and amateurs are the main archetypes,
interrogators, snipers, and demolition specialists also fall into this
category.[80]  

Occult agents can be varied and are largely up to the Storyteller to
include them. On one hand they are something like occult advisors from
the Arcanum or defecting Thin-bloods. They may be composed of enslaved
Kindred, mystics, psychics, abandoned ghouls, or even old
[Tzimisce](./tzimisce.md)
monstrosities. [81]  

### Opposing Force

Called “OPFOR” is a team a Storyteller builds to oppose their players’
characters. Storytellers may consider where the characters are, how the
SI plays into the story, how competent the OPFOR is, and how they caught
the attention of the Si members. They can be a mix of skills or a
focused cell and what their general purpose is. Storytellers are able to
come up with background, SPC motivations, and begin to plan the conflict
to challenge the players.

### Equipment

The Coalition uses many items in their secret war against Kindred. They
can be various mundane arms, armor and military grade weapons.
Crossbows, stakes, or military level assault rifles will be seen in
their ranks. Their vehicles range from black helicopters to drones to
Armored SUVs and anything in between. They also possess access to Xtech
rare, effective tools used to fight Kindred. Each part of the world,
what the Coalition can plausibly get away with, and how the Storyteller
builds the SI antagonist causes differences in tools available. Below
are some samples of equipment used. [82]  

XScopes - Monitors heartbeat, respiration, and body heat. They are
installed in many airports disguised as cameras. The first generation of
them can be deceived by Blush of Life, but the second generation looks
at blood flow making it difficult for non-Duskborn who are not lifelike
to deceive. Many second generation types are installed in international
airports.[83]

Incendiary Weapons - Lethal and effective, these are the bane of
Kindred. Tracer rounds might not cause Aggravated damage, the others
can. This includes Dragon’s Breath rounds, Raufoss, Hafla,
flamethrowers, Molotov cocktails, and explosives.[84]

Stake Launcher - Replacing the grenades in grenade launchers with
stakes. This proves very effective.[85]

Phase Motion Detector - A device known as a screamer, as it lets out a
high pitched sound when its microwaves detect motion.
[Obfuscated](./obfuscate.md)
Kindred do well to not be detected by such traps.[86]

Velum Sanctuarii - Called “Holy Veil” in English, though known also as
“Red Gas” to Kindred. This is a mysterious weapon only the Entity and
occasionally BOES uses on high ranking Kindred targets. To humans they
see nothing, to Kindred they see a red mist, hear screams and wails, and
experience a burning sensation. Usually used to funnel Kindred into
traps. This has appeared in both
<a href="LA_by_Night" class="wikilink" title="LA by Night">LA by
Night</a> as well as featured as a game mechanic in
<a href="Vampire:_The_Masquerade_Bloodhunt" class="wikilink"
title="Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodhunt">Vampire: The Masquerade
Bloodhunt</a>. [87]

### Artifacts

This covers all of the mystical artifacts many hunters discover and use.
There are generally three types of these artifacts: Icons, Relics, and
Armamenta. Storytellers are encouraged to make up their own artifacts
for their game.

The Vatican has a large store of Relics, loans them out usually only to
BOES and seldomly IAO and FIRSTLIGHT. The Akritai have a collection that
favors Icons, even though
[Brujah](./brujah.md) destroyed
many of them once upon a time. FBI’s SAD has a vault with many occult
and esoteric items.[88][89][90]

Icons - The term can cover any large installation or tapestry, but
statues or carved reliefs are what survived the test of time. Made by
either occult artists who infused Icons with special properties or
occultists who knew powerful geometric ratios to protect places of
worship, these items affect Kindred upon looking at them or sometimes
vice versa. Some varieties work on more than just Kindred. [91]

Relics - .These items make True Faith more powerful and act as a conduit
providing unique benefits to the user or maluses to Kindred. In the
hands of mortals lacking True Faith or mere Kindred, these items are
powerless, some even curse Kindred for attempting to use them.[92]

Armamenta - Meaning equipment in Latin, these are very rare and unique
artifacts. They are usually deadly to Kindred. These types of artifacts
also tend to hurt the user if used improperly.[93]

### Terms

**Blank body** - Refers to the readings Kindred gives off on infrared
cameras. Now the name used to refer to them.

**The Coalition** - What the Five Torches and its allies call secret
global hunting vampire conspiracy. It is mostly what Kindred means with
the Second Inquisition, but The Coalition is not all hunters.

**Farm Team** - A name for the other hunters outside of the Coalition,
tongue-in-cheek way of calling these outsiders the minor league. They
too make up the Second Inquisition.

**Second Inquisition** - The current movement by kine to wage a secret
war against Kindred. This number of Kindred has not risen up since the
old days of the First Inquisition.[94]

**X tech** - Vampire hunting gear that is rare and expensive. FIRSTLIGHT
is the only one with enough resources to make the gear available. Others
may buy in small quantities, though GRU turns to the black market.[95]
