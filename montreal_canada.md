## Important Events

### Sabbat Rule

Kindred were already in Quebec, back when it was called New France. In
1763, a year after control of New France was handed over from France to
England, Kyle Strathcona arrived in the city. Strathcona had already
garnered a reputation that was feared in both
<a href="Sabbat" class="wikilink" title="Sabbat">Sabbat</a> and
<a href="Camarilla" class="wikilink" title="Camarilla">Camarilla</a>
circles from his status as a
<a href="Ventrue" class="wikilink" title="Ventrue">Ventrue</a> war hero.
After his arrival he dissolved the Montreal Primogen council and placed
himself as the dictator of Montreal. Other Camarilla members disliked
this act and made a move to dispose of the Ventrue tyrant.

Strathcona was victorious, able to destroy or committed
<a href="diablerie" class="wikilink" title="diablerie">diablerie</a> on
those that stood against him. Those that survived fled to Quebec City.
He revealed his Sabbat leanings, always preferring their ideology.
Montreal changed hands to the Sabbat with him as the Archbishop. He
started his crusade of driving Camarilla loyalists out of various
Canadian cities. In 1812 he became Archbishop of Canada he sometimes
even called himself Cardinal of North America by his own account.

Montreal had several coups all of which Strathcona suppressed. At some
point, Strathcona kidnapped Francois Dumas, a childe of
<a href="Francois_Villon" class="wikilink"
title="François Villon">François Villon</a> and master builder. Dumas
was forced into constructing Strathcona’s grand idea for a dark temple
beneath the city. Dumas planted clues and hints around Montreal in hopes
someone will save him when Strathcona discarded him. Many of those who
helped Dumas were destroyed, but the keys to his tomb were hidden. In
1850, he had the Temple of Eternal Whispers as a monument of propaganda
and a way to deify himself. He forcefully entombed Dumas deeper within
his own creation.[15]

Montreal was thought of as the dark faith capital of the sect. They had
been ruled for centuries by the sect. The city had been known for the
inhumane acts of ritual sacrifices, bloody orgies, pack turf wars,
diablerie, and many more. Finding dismembered
<a href="kine" class="wikilink" title="kine">kine</a> in the streets was
not too uncommon before the Night of Ashes. Strathcona saw himself as an
antichrist figure to steep North America into bloodshed and
darkness.[16][17]

### Night of Ashes

During a dark mass at the Temple of Eternal Whispers, the Sabbat were
attacked by the Second Inquisition. A mix of hunter cells and FIRSTLIGHT
were able to systematically burn out the havens of Sabbat packs. Those
that survived either hid or were forewarned of such an attack. The
Cardinal Kyle Strathcona was said to have met
<a href="Final_death" class="wikilink" title="Final Death">Final
Death</a>.[18][19]

Unbeknownst to many, the Night of Ashes was orchestrated by
<a href="Francois_Villon" class="wikilink"
title="François Villon">François Villon</a> and Caleb Duval directing
FIRSTLIGHT to the Sabbat during an important mass, ensuring their
massacre. The SI agents’ charges used on the Temple of Eternal Whispers
buried it and in turn, Dumas, unfortunately. A cell of religious hunters
used the church over the buried Temple as their new base of operations,
the cathedral Mary, Queen of the World.[20]

### Modern Montreal

The Camarilla has taken over the domain. Martin Hilkers has been
installed as Prince with <a href="Francois_Villon" class="wikilink"
title="François Villon">François Villon</a> as his backer. Though some
say Prince Hilkers is nothing more than a puppet. While the Camarilla
controlled most of Montreal there is an
<a href="Anarch" class="wikilink" title="Anarch">Anarch</a> presence led
by Yuma McKinzie, former Sabbat
<a href="Gangrel" class="wikilink" title="Gangrel">Gangrel</a>. The two
sects are tense, but not at war. The
<a href="Hecata" class="wikilink" title="Hecata">Hecata</a> wait in the
wings seeing which side is most advantageous.[21][22]

### Events of Vampire: The Masquerade Chapters

Kindred of Clan
<a href="Toreador" class="wikilink" title="Toreador">Toreador</a> begin
to disappear around Montreal and there is the appearance of a suspicious
white van. Taking a more than a week to follower up, Prince Hilkers
finally assembles a team of neonates to investigate these
disappearances. This investigation forces the team to face off against a
Sabbat priest one night and a werewolf later. They are eventually able
to destroy the lupine, but find the werewolf had a mysterious key
fragment on their person. They compete with the Sabbat priest to acquire
the rest of these key fragments. The race became more dire when Elysium
was defiled with the decaying body of a missing Toreador, falling victim
to
<a href="Diablerie" class="wikilink" title="Diablerie">Diablerie</a>.[23][24][25]

The investigation turns to collecting the key fragments. These nights
include a heist of the Redpath Museum for a fragment and a trip to the
Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery. The latter has a zombie horde raised by
the Sabbat priest to chase the coterie into Mount Royal. The hotwire
clears a concert on their run and calls for Caleb to help. Caleb
enlisted <a href="Aurora_Rosselini" class="wikilink"
title="Aurora Rosselini">Aurora Rosselini</a> and
<a href="Edward_Harvey" class="wikilink" title="Edward Harvey">Edward
Harvey</a> to stop a possible massive breach with their
<a href="Oblivion" class="wikilink" title="Oblivion">Oblivion</a>
powers.[26]

The key fragments all align and reveal that Mary, Queen of the World is
where this key points to. The issue is the location is hunter territory.
After possible sabotage Caleb and the coterie work to eliminate the
hunters present. The Sabbat priest finally meets Final Death; defeated
by the coterie then beheaded by Caleb. They are able to open the chamber
and recover a torpor and blood hungry François Dumas,
<a href="childe" class="wikilink" title="childe">childe</a> of
<a href="Francois_Villon" class="wikilink"
title="François Villon">François Villon</a>. When he talks he goes over
how he was forced to build the Temple of Eternal Whispers and then
locked in the depths. The rescue of Dumas is never reported, in fact the
attack on the hunters was blamed on the coterie for needlessly attacking
hunters. The Montreal coterie is marked by the Montreal Camarilla as
person non grata by Caleb and told to leave. The group goes to the
<a href="Anarch" class="wikilink" title="Anarchs">Anarchs</a> for
sanctuary.[27][28]

The coterie breaks into the Ivory Tower city headquarters in an attempt
to discuss the true situation with Prince Martin Hilkers. Prince Hilkers
is destroyed by Caleb and the coterie is blamed for it. A formal Blood
Hunt is called on the coterie. The coterie has to avoid being destroyed
and try to once again negotiate asylum with the Anarchs. François Villon
is said to be visiting town. The coterie is able to have a clandestine
meeting with the Prince of
<a href="Paris,_France" class="wikilink" title="Paris">Paris</a> and
Caleb for a final confrontation and resolution. The nature of the
meeting shapes Montreal.[29][30]
