The Beckoning is a mysterious force calling the elders away from their
domain, even the elders that have taken their position as Princes in
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md)
domains. These elders have all but disappeared or have become incredibly
hard to reach and their sudden departure leaves the domains they once
controlled open to
[Anarch](./anarch.md) attacks.
This sudden shift isn't a complete loss, however, as younger kindred are
able to take claim of domains as Princes.[1] While other Kindred may be
able to resist the call for some time, the Sabbat are drawn to it and
even those who cannot hear it willingly follow their sires and pack
leaders to the fight. This led to the Sabbat plunging themselves
headlong into the Gehenna war and thinning their ranks elsewhere. There
is a supposed secret that the Sabbat knows that no other sect does so
far, which is that the Gehenna war affects much more territory and is
not confined to the cradle of civilization. Due to the diaspora of
peoples the vampires that hid among them have spread across the world
and likewise the Antediluvians, making the Gehenna War a worldwide
theatre.[2]
