## Overview

Chimera are referring to a creature made from the amalgamation of
others. The method varies be it from
[Fleshcrafting](./protean.md#fleshcrafting),
<a href="Thin-blood_Alchemy" class="wikilink"
title="Thin-Blood Alchemy">Thin-Blood Alchemy</a>, black market DNA
manipulation, and
[Blood Sorcery](./blood_sorcery.md); they all can attribute to a wide array of chimeras. Many
show up in many apocalyptic
[alchemical](./alchemy.md)
societies’ compounds,
[Ipsissimus](./tremere.md#house-ipsissimus) chantries, and places in the

varied dictated by what their designer wished to create.[1] 

## Chimera experiment examples

- **Nyukach** - Also known as the sniffer. These chimeras were created
  by [Lui Domien](./other_groups.md#lui-domien)
  [Tzimisce](./tzimisce.md).
  They resemble the grey aliens from science fiction with elongated
  limbs, mouths, and eyes. The nyukachy are able to inhale and ingest
  toxins, chemically process them, and then excrete it in a pure state
  through waste or bodily fluids. Experienced nyukach can even identify
  chemicals through smell and taste alone.[2]
- **Corvidians** - This chimera was created by a Japanese biologist and
  <a href="Thin-blood_Alchemy" class="wikilink"
  title="Thin-blood alchemist">Thin-blood alchemist</a> in a bid to
  protect their family. They created a mystical DNA treatment process
  with raven blood. The mortal is given bird-like features, long
  distance sight, and immunity to
  [Presence](./presence.md),
  [Dominate](./dominate.md), and
  [Animalism](./animalism.md).[3]
- **Counterfeit Wolfman** - Made by magically infusing
  <a href="lupine" class="wikilink" title="lupine">lupine</a> blood into
  a [Choleric](./resonance.md#choleric) mortal. This chimera loses all reason.
  Some use these creations' rampage as an intimidation tactic to keep
  others <a href="Kindred" class="wikilink" title="Kindred">Kindred</a>
  away from the creator’s domain.
- **Donkey People** - With some made in South America, these chimeras
  are created to resemble donkeys, but their blood is as nourishing and
  as pleasant as mortal blood to Kindred. Their feet betray their nature
  as does the agony in their eyes.
