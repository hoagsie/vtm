## Overview

Willpower is a tracker, with both a maximum rating and a temporary
amount of points to be used. It represents the character's confidence
and determination to accomplish a task and is built from Composure +
Resolve. It is not possible to purchase additional points of Willpower
alone, instead, it is only increased by increasing either one of those
stats.

### Spending Willpower

Players may spend their character's Willpower in a variety of ways and
when doing so, must mark the tracker with one Superficial damage. Should
the character hit Willpower 0, they are left Impaired and receives a -2
dice penalty for Social and Mental tests. Superficial damage is tracked
with an "/" on one of the boxes per point taken, with Aggravated tracked
using an "X" in each box per point taken.

- They may use Willpower to reroll up to three dice (the dice cannot be
  Hunger dice) in any pool, except when the rules specifically exclude
  Willpower such as tracker rolls
  (<a href="Humanity#Remorse" class="wikilink" title="Remorse">Remorse</a>
  tests, <a href="Frenzy" class="wikilink" title="Frenzy">Frenzy</a>
  tests), or One-Roll Conflict), etc.
- Willpower may be spent to take control of their character for one turn
  during a frenzy or when under the influence of certain

- To perform minor movements, such as movement of a finger while staked.
- To ignore <a href="Health" class="wikilink" title="Health">Health</a>
  damage penalties, including Impairment, for one turn.

### Recovering Superficial Willpower damage

- Characters may recover their Superficial Willpower damage at the
  beginning of a session equal to either their Composure or Resolve
  (whichever is highest between the two). Unless, the session ends on a
  cliffhanger where the dwindling supply of Willpower provides a strong
  dramatic tension.
- At the <a href="Storyteller" class="wikilink"
  title="Storyteller&#39;s">Storyteller's</a> discretion, once per
  session, a character who acts to fulfill their desire may immediately
  recover 1 point of damage.
- At the Storyteller's discretion, a character who plays out a

  <a href="Compulsion" class="wikilink" title="Compulsion">Compulsion</a>
  in a dramatic way can recover one or more Superficial Willpower
  damage.

### Recovering Aggravated Willpower damage

- At the Storyteller's discretion, a character can recover one or more
  points of Aggravated Willpower damage when they have acted to
  significantly benefit a Touchstone, or by following a Conviction to
  their determent.
- Characters can heal 1 point of Aggravated damage at the end of a
  session when the character has worked towards their Ambition.[1]
