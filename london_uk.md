## Overview

Capital of both the UK and England. The city has always been a favorable
domain for Kindred. It was thought that at the turn of the millennium
there were over 200 Kindred in the city's metropolitan area.
Unsanctioned vampires in the city are considered free game for the
scourge of others to hunt, even adding to the culture of the city. For
centuries the city was ruled by
<a href="Mithras" class="wikilink" title="Mithras">Mithras</a> until the
1940s when
<a href="Queen_Anne" class="wikilink" title="Queen Anne">Queen Anne</a>
took power. After 2012, the Second Inquisition is said to have severely
culled the kindred in London.[1][2]

- King of Shadows - A mysterious kindred who rules through debt,
  proxies, organized crime, and the underground. Assumed to be
  Nosferatu, but could be anyone. Still rules after Fall of London.[30]

### Cult of Mithras

- Mithras, Ventrue - The ancient methuselah center of the
  [Cult of Mithras](./mithraic_mysteries.md)' worship. Former Prince
  and God-Emperor of London; he’s ruled London since the Londinium days.
  A plot to destroy him led him to barely surviving Valerius’
  assassination attempt, werewolves, and the
  [Sabbat](./sabbat.md) only to be
  accidentally diablerized by Monty Covens. The methuselah survives in a
  weakened state and plots his revenge. He uses Monty's body to get
  allies in the Sabbat.[31][32]
- Montgomery “Monty” Covens, Banu Haqim - Sabbat member and would be
  diablerist of Mithras from the Sabbat. Mithras has most control, but
  there are moments his persona can assert dominance.[33]
- Roger de Camden, Cappadocian - Prince of Edinburgh, member of the
  [Hecata](./hecata.md), and Pater
  of their Cult of Mithras. Formerly advisor and lover to Mithras, seeks
  to aid him in getting revenge. He faked his death to avoid the
  Giovanni purge centuries ago and has the alias “Pater Thomas.” He
  survives the events of London and leads the Cult of Mithras from it's
  new capital in his domain.[34]
- Gwenllian Arwyn, Brujah - Elder from druidic Britain times, defeated
  when Mithras arrived at the Roman invasion. Originally intended to
  wait out Mithras, she ended up serving him for centuries working as a
  diplomat and soon Pater of the London cell. Now that he is weakened
  she plans to take the throne of London.[35]
- Rose Abawi, Toreador - Childe of Regina Blake and groomed to be the

  to be the Voice of Mithras. Back up in case Gwenllian betrays Mithras.
  She leads the cult in the modern nights.[36][37]
- Sri Sansa, Tremere - Known as a hedonist, faux-occultist con artist.
  His con attracted his sire's attention, fooling him into an embrace.
  Soon Mithras inducted him into the Cult, taking Sri much deeper into
  this con than intended. He leaves the city with his family come the
  Fall of London.[38][39]
- Darius Shirazi, Malkavian - Former professor whose interest in the
  Mithras legends got him inducted in the cult and working as their
  chronicler.[40]

### Mortals

- Ishaq Khan - Detective Inspector who started to dig into odd crimes in
  London during his time in SO13. When he asked too many questions,
  Kindred kidnapped and embraced his children. This kick started his
  <a href="True_Faith" class="wikilink" title="True Faith">True Faith</a>
  and he had a quench for revenge ever since he felt he had nothing to
  lose. He formed his own dark ops unit called Extraordinary
  Counter-Terrorism Unit (ECTU). His group worked with other London
  groups to plan Operation Antigen which led to the Fall of London to
  the
  [SI](./second_inquisition.md).[41]

### Groups

- Brixton Massive - An
  [Anarch](./anarch.md) group in
  Brixton.[42]
- Southwark Council - An Anarch Group in South London.[43]
- Hunt Club - Secret organization who love to hunt  and diablerize
  kindred for sport since WWII era. They think in the modern nights,
  hunters may be fun new prey.[44]
- Court of Shadows - Led by the King of Shadows. Their network of agents
  are taken care of with food and shelter via organized crime
  connections. Prominent in London subterranean landscape.[45]
- Operation Antigen - A coalition of police, military, and Intelligence
  assets who burned out kindred influence from London. It is still
  active to make sure Kindred influence does not return.[46]
- Heralds of the Sun - Each century Mithras has followers take part in a
  ritual called the Blooding. it overwrite their memories with
  collective will of the member's vitae they have consumed. Making him
  perfect servants and assassins. The four awakened in 2012 are to aid
  in his ascension.[47]

## Prominent Locations

- The Shard - London’s tallest building and located in the Southwark
  district of the city. Among Kindred it is so associated with Kindred
  it is even nicknamed The Scepter. Queen Anne and other Ventrue were
  silent partners in the development. The top floors 66/67 serve as
  their exclusive use for Clan Ventrue and Queen Anne. Sometimes Elysium
  parties are held here. Operation Antigen attacked the upper floors at
  the beginning of the SI assault on London.[48]
- Slimelight - A night club that forms a nexus for the goth, fetish and
  industrial scene. Open hours compatible with Kindred in the Islington
  district in an event space known as The Electrowerkz. It has proven to
  be a place to find blood dolls and drug-laced blood.[49]
- The Kingsway Exchange - An underground shelter built during World
  War II. This large shelter is tucked under Chancery Lane station and
  has a secret hotel and meeting venue for visiting kindred diplomats
  and their retainers. It is run by Camarilla-aligned
  [Lasombra](./lasombra.md),
  Stephen Lenoir and invite only.[50]
- The Trunk - A popular LGBTQ+ friendly night club in the Dalton area
  with nightly themes. It is ruled by Reginia Blake, as it resides in
  her domain and the deed is hers. She used to host allies there and
  treats it as a personal Elysium. During the Fall of London the club
  was burned down by Antigen.[51][52]
- The British Museum - Queen Anne declares the Museum a neutral space,
  but allows Regina Blake to hold Elysium there, though Gwenllian Arwyn
  is the true master of the museum. Was a popular Elysium, but Antigen
  has seen it no longer used.[53]
- London Mithraeum - The Temple of Mithras had three layers, the surface
  for mortals, an underground component for Kindred, and  two rooms for
  Mithras himself in the past. Now it is not used as a tourist spot.
  Underground Kindred spots are sealed. Rarely used by Kindred in modern
  day.[54][55]
- The Mithraic Warehouse - it looks like a normal warehouse in the Royal
  Docks and on paper it houses overflow items from the British Museum.
  Darius Shirazi controls it in connection to the Mithraic Mysteries.
  The location serves as a museum with private kindred viewings.[56]
- Blue Monsoon Lounge - An old pub that was the first to talk rupees in
  London. It is neutral ground for West London kindred to socialize and
  have meetings, even though it is in Sri Sansa’s domain.[57]
- Roti Mojo - A loud fast food joint in the suburb of Southall, while
  True Kindred would not find it interesting it is a meeting spot for
  London’s
  [Duskborn](./thinblood.md).
  It operates as the thin-bloods unsanctioned, unofficial Elysium.[58]

### Anarch Locations

- The Electric - A warehouse-style club located in Brixton, south
  London. It has contemporary art on display and a popular location of
  Anarchs. The Anarchs gang that congregate there calls themselves the
  Brixton Massive.[59] Abandoned after the Fall of London.[60]
- The Coronet Theatre - A slightly rundown building in Elephant and
  Castle, this art deco style building is used for raves and
  exhibitions. The other major Anarch group, Southwark Council, uses
  this as a usual hangout.[61]

### Other Locations

- Open Feeding Grounds - Old West End and old East End are considered
  open feeding grounds to all, during Queen Anne’s reign.[62]
- London Under London - Old lines of London Underground, crypts,
  basements of old buildings, all create this underground landscape some
  kindred may utilize.[63]
- Other Elysia - Major Museums, galleries, and Theatres are all regarded
  as neutral ground.[64]
- Major Green Spaces and Parks - Are usually avoided as they are
  regarded as Lupine territory.[65]

## Baronies of Avalon and Other Domains

London acts as the central domain of a larger domain made up of
tributaries. The smaller domains are called baronies, but not in the
Anarch sense. These are other domains in the UK called the Baronies of
Avalon. The other cities and Princes in the UK such as Liverpool,
Manchester, [Edinburgh](./edinburgh_scotland.md), and
[Birmingham](./birmingham_uk.md) pay tribute and defer to London. Once
the London court even stretched power to New England, encompassing
[Boston](./boston_mass.md).

In recent nights before 2012, the baronies pushed for more autonomy
which <a href="Anne_Bowesley" class="wikilink" title="Queen Anne">Queen
Anne</a> has begrudgingly granted, and Boston along with the rest of New
England have largely shed their British overlords.[66][67] Though some
surviving London Camarilla members and Mithras worshippers look to
Boston as a domain to fall back on after London's fall.[68]

After the Fall of London, the other domains of the UK prepared
themselves against the mortal hunters. The SI found it was harder to
replicate London’s operation without the element of surprise or the free
intel that
<a href="Roger_de_Camden" class="wikilink" title="de Camden">de
Camden</a> and
<a href="Mithras" class="wikilink" title="Mithras">Mithras</a> provided.

Because of London's fall,
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md)
Barons of Avalon now call themselves Princes and the few
[Anarch](./anarch.md) cities keep
the title Baron.[69]

## Important Events

### Rise of Mithras

<a href="Mithras" class="wikilink" title="Mithras">Mithras</a> first
came to London in the Londinium days in 1st century CE. The forces he
arrived with from Rome was led by general Aulus Plautius under Emperor
Claudius.[70] Mithras claimed the isle of Britannia as his own. He
became entrenched in London around 313 CE and was able to bring
followers from Rome to London establishing the most important Mithraic
cell. He established blood Laws for his domains, something some think
were appropriate by the
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md)
centuries later; other kindred could only stay if they did so under his
rule. Londinium was ruled with an iron fist and he slowly collected
Kindred and Kine cultists loyal to him. When the Romans withdrew from
Britannia, this mirrored local Kindred revolts, Mithras was able to win
but fell into torpor. His cult largely ruled in his stead.[71][72]

Mithras awoke again 1066 CE, finding his cult diminished. The following
years saw London experience the fighting between Mithras’ followers and
local [Ventrue](./ventrue.md)
lords for dominance. The local lords' grievances and in fighting allowed
Mithras to get the support of younger kindred and dominate the island.
More Kindred started to come to London intrigued by Mithras; one
<a href="Roger_de_Camden" class="wikilink" title="Roger de Camden">Roger
de Camden</a> arrived in the 11th Century and became his seneschal as
well as secret lover. By 1154 CE Mithras was able to claim the Baronies
of Avalon as his.[73][74][75]

The following years saw Mithraic Mysteries as helping run the city and
the Island at Mithras’ behest, often looking over the domain when he
fell into torpor or left. When the Giovanni started their purges, de
Camden invented the Ritual of Transferring Soul to fake his death and
started the persona Pater Thomas in the 16th century. This made Mithras
hold the Giovanni in poor standing forever after.  The two clans that
often were at odds with London were Toreadors and Tremere. Toreadors
aligned with Scotland and France  often interpreted that Ventrue
dominated England’s plots. The
[Tremere](./tremere.md) were a
new clan he disliked that also often sided with the
[Toreador](./toreador.md). This
came to an end in the 17th century when Mithras had the Toreadors elders
of Scotland sign the Treaty of Durham. The treaty was a pact of mutual
non-interference which brought an end to the Toreador-led political
plays against the Ventrue. They traded hostages to seal this treaty.[76]

### Valerius Reign

In 1798, Mithras left
<a href="Valerius" class="wikilink" title="Valerius">Valerius</a> as the
regent of the domain while the methuselah went into
[Torpor](./torpor.md). He was even
given the official seal of Mithras for his documents.  Mithras’ absence
went on longer than his previous one, which made Valerius have to truly
take control. His childe,
<a href="Anne_Bowesley" class="wikilink" title="Anne">Anne</a>, helped
him with the city plotting to be more influential. Valerius started to
see Mithras saw the city possessively and made decisions for it to grow
to prominence. He made concessions to the
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md) in
exchange for their aid in consolidation of more power in Britain.
Valerius envisioned making the whole island a single domain with London
as the heart.

One hundred years later in the 1800s, Mithras returned so enraged at
Valerius’ policies he stripped him of rank and threw him out physically.
He rolled back Valerius' changes to make London a powerful city-state
with tributaries from its Baronies rather than a united Avalon domain.
Mithras saw Lady Anne as the desirable regent from then on when he left
the city from now on over Valerius.[77][78]

### Victorian Era

In the Victorian Era, there was a time when the
[Minister](./ministry.md)
methuselah and old lover of Mithras, Kemintiri, came to London under the
Guise of Lady Ophelia Merritt. Her plots allowed her to have Mithras
fall into madness and corrupt the kindred of London. Mithras temporarily
lost control of some of his thralls. A rogue sect of Tremere and
Valerius conspired to destroy him with Regina’s Blake mother as a
poisoned vessel. The plot was thwarted thanks to the other Tremere,
<a href="Victoria_Ash" class="wikilink" title="Victoria Ash">Victoria
Ash</a>, and Regina allowing Mithras to be restored so he can enforce
order. This made him permanently ban any Ministry for settling in
London, and have him start to develop counters to the Warlocks. Ever
since then, the Ministry have officially been banned form the
city.[79][80][81]

### Death of Mithras

In the 1940, Valerius realized Pater Thomas was secretly Mithras’ lover.
Furthermore Mithras’ old spy master, de Worde, revealed Pater Thomas was
de Camden having cheated death. Valerius and de Worde  took the
[Cappadocian](./hecata.md)
hostage to lure Mithras into a trap. They hid the staked de Camden at
Gunpowder Mills. When Mithras arrived Valerius watched from a safe
distance as the facility exploded certain of Mithras’ and de Camden’s
death. He waited months to make sure they died and then admitted to his
childe, Lady Anne, what he had done. She took the news in stride and
announced Mithras’ death, blaming the London Blitz for causing his Final
Death. She used the head start to declare her praxis and dub herself
Queen Anne, the new Prince of London and promoted Valerius to Seneschal.
This political shift caused different cells of Mithraic Mysteries to
drop in membership. Different cells rose and fell, since Mithras felt so
quiet cells were disconnected.[82][83]

What Valerius didn’t account for was Mithras’ survival. He had enough
time to free de Camden allowing the Cappadocian to slip into the
Shadowlands. Mithras couldn’t escape, but his elder
[Fortitude](./fortitude.md)
saved him from destruction. He fled south to lupine territory where he
succumbed to his wounds and fell into torpor. De Camden used his
necromancy to interrogate spirits and confirm Mithras has survived.
Without allies, cult, or resources and his identity was known, he had to
bide his time, the Cappadocian laid low for 50 years.[84]

At the turn of the 21st century, de Camden and a
[Sabbat](./sabbat.md) Harbinger,
Alcoan, struck a deal. Her pack would look for Mithras for months
eventually finding him buried in the earth. She and most of her pack
died by the Lupines. The survivor, Monty Covens, attempted to diablerize
Mithras; this led to Mithras taking some control of him. With a new 
plotting to take over London.[85]

### Fall of London

Mithras waited for three things to strike: the Kindred understanding to
Gehenna to move past apocalyptic hysteria, the rise of the Second
Inquisition, and the recovery of torpid vampires, his Heralds of the
Suns, from the London Mithraeum. He dropped off information of high
profile kindred to the Newburgh Group and tasked his Heralds with
collecting artifacts. So he may use de Camden’s Transferring of the Soul
ritual to attain his full power.

London’s Fall started with an attack on the Shard, the Ventrue symbol of
power in London. Unbeknownst to others, Queen Anne escaped the attack on
the Shard, rumors swirling that she is hiding to recover power with help
of Justiciar Parr. Tremere primogen Edward Bainbridge and
[Brujah](./brujah.md) Primogen
Reginald Moore have a tenuous alliance between their clans. Other
kindred call “Landlords” fight over territory from the shadows. The
throne of London is empty and many kindred have fled the domain. It is
unknown if Mithras’ plan worked or if the Methuselah was truly
destroyed, but is unknown London is a shell of itself for Kindred.
Operation Antigen even declares, falsely, that London is a Kindred free
zone.[86]

Seven years after the fall in 2019, Kindred lives in the domain
regardless of the rumors, but there are rules they live by now. Many are
[thin-bloods](./thinblood.md), Toreador, and
[Nosferatu](./nosferatu.md),
but there are others.  A major meeting with the Landlords of London and
the King of Shadows lead to the formation of the Compact; rules they
agreed on how to live in London. Oskar Anasov, former Herald, was
instrumental in the write up of The Compact.[87]

## The Compact

Rules the Landlords of London and King of Shadows have discussed and
agreed on. Significant factor in kindred survival in London.[88]

- **No use of Public Transportation** - Avoid London’s Airports, trains,
  and buses as they are always under surveillance. Many avoid the city
  center.
- **No use of electronic media, and no open communication** - No use of
  information storing devices. Many use dead drops, couriers, ciphers,
  and carrier pigeons.
- **No Elysium** - Former Elysia and any high security locations are
  avoided. Large groups are discouraged. Meeting are encouraged to not
  be in public possibly through servants.
- **No Prince** - A prince seems impossible with a large area and
  limited communication. Each Landlord recognizes each other’s authority
  and offers assistance or sanctuary in times of need. This creates a
  series of strongmen in a fragmented London.
