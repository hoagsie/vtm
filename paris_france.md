## Overview

Paris is one of the remaining traditional Camarilla strongholds in
Europe; traditionally
[London](./london_uk.md),
<a href="Locations#Berlin,_Germany" class="wikilink"
title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, and Paris were considered the strongest
Camarilla domains. With London falling to the
[Second Inquisition](./second_inquisition.md) and Berlin falling to
an Anarch uprising. Paris still stands as the Camarilla last crown jewel
in Europe.

Though a strong domain it is repressive.
[Caitiff](./caitiff.md), the
[thin-blood](./thinblood.md),
[Anarch](./anarch.md) and even
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md)
Kindred lacking proper connections can have a hard time. Prince Villon
has gotten more powerful and more demanding. With the domain still
strong and a strong sense of arrogance, the prince may even turn away
even ancilla from a crumbling Camarilla domain for the slightest reason,
such as looks.  

Often said the court resembled the ancien régime and is steeped in
degeneracy, but has an underlying power structure that the bold and
interesting can take advantage of.[1]

## Important Events

### French Revolution

By the 1700s, Paris was considered the heart of still young
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md).
[Inquisition](./second_inquisition.md) had settled, the Lupine were kept to
the wooded countryside, the
[Sabbat](./sabbat.md) had never
made incursion, and the domain seemed safe from any crisis. With
Villon’s rule it was essentially unchallenged.[20]

In 1789, Prince <a href="Francois_Villon" class="wikilink"
title="François Villon">François Villon</a> and his court members Maria
Antoinette and Suzanne Rochelle met with Lucita of
[Clan Lasombra](./lasombra.md), Karsh of
[Clan Gangrel](./gangrel.md),
and Vannevar Thomas of
[Clan Ventrue](./ventrue.md).
Each comes from a different domain to warn the Prince of the turbulent
political situation that is spreading throughout the world. Versailles
is stormed by a mob with the aid of the Sabbat. They are forced to flee
aided by the help of legendary
[Nosferatu](./nosferatu.md)
architect, Zelios.[21]

The French Revolution was a time of mass changes and the uprooting of
old hierarchies. The human affair reverberated into Kindred affairs.
Clans who usually held power tended to embrace from privileged groups to
to leverage their connections and assets for the clan. These clans
typically were the Toreador, Ventrue,
[Tremere](./tremere.md), and
[Brujah](./brujah.md). Soon the
Kindred started to embrace outside these ranks creating a new faction of
Kindred who were younger and demanded reform, the Bohemians. The
Bohemians petitions for more opportunity and mobility to younger kindred
in Camarilla domains. Their main base of operation was Montmartre. With
François Villon and his court in exile, the Bohemians with their leader,
Félicien Beaumont, are able to rule.[22]

All over Europe but especially Paris, Absolute Monarchy falls to popular
uprises. Many older kindred lose their assets, retainers and havens.
This is a stark comparison to the Bohemians and other younger kindred,
who are better able to stay hidden, adapt, and eventually recoup their
losses. These younger Kindred are even able to seize power, assets, and
property. The younger kindred seemed to organically change hierarchy.
François Villon and other elders slip into their old ways of putting
their younger kindred in their place, causing tension to spike between
factions.

As the Revolution kicked off, Anarchs traveled to Paris to feed under
cover of the riots. As the mortal government instituted the Reign of
Terror against enemies of the Revolution, Anarch gangs led by
charismatic leaders on being Dalia Nakache, flocked to Paris in massive
numbers. The Anarchs see this as a golden age. Even attracts the likes
of a young Agata Starek. Some Anarchs sought to revel in the bloody
affairs, others sought new ideas.[23]

The Camarilla loyalists saw this time as a right for constant survival.
Both Kindred and mortal proved dangerous. Some Camarilla kindred were
dragged from their havens by mortal revolutionaries to meet
[Final Death](./final_death.md). Félicien Beaumont and the Bohemians protected important
assets and worked to keep the Camarilla alive in Paris. While keeping to
the background they also formed important alliances.[24]

Paris nearly becomes an Anarch hub, young Kindred both Anarch and
Camarilla come out Paris for opportunity. Events in Saint-Domingue have
made the city become more multicultural. Mortal politics and Regime
shape the end of the Revolution; all coalesce some progressive reforms,
while welcoming a middle class, they still gave power to the elite. This
allowed the Bohemians and exiled old guard to form a truce and a united
front against Anarch expansion. The final purges push many Anarchs into
exile or hiding, though many remain in communities of the city. On the
cusps of the 19th century,  François Villon took the city back, but he
made rarer appearances. François allowed Félicien Beaumont to manage the
Elysium grounds as his steward of the Paris Court.[25]

### Night of Blood Tears

In 1822, the grandchilde of Prince François Villon was to be married off
in a [Blood Wedding](./blood_bond.md) to childe of then Regent Valerius to secure an alliance;
Louise Maria de Rambaud and Anne Bowelsey, respectively. The wedding was
to take place in
[London](./london_uk.md) overseen
by Villon’s Childe then Justiciar Violetta, but many of the Parisian
guests were destroyed by pro-Mithras followers' sudden attack. Louise
Maria and Violetta survived  returning to Paris, this became an infamous
political incident among the London and Paris Kindred.[26]

### Montmartre Massacre

In the 1830s, Prince François Villon noticed Paris had too many Kindred.
This was because of how many allies he allowed to embrace and the number
of  illegal Embraces  Prince Villon instituted a population control
policy. First Kindred destroyed in secret, then high-profile Blood Hunts
on violators, and finally the destruction of
<a href="fledgling" class="wikilink" title="fledgling">fledgling</a>
[coteries](./coterie.md). The
latter done by either fire or the blade of the Scourge.  This systemic
culling became known as the Montmartre Massacre. Some believe it was a
right of a Prince, Anarchs see it as a reason for revolution the
Camarilla as a whole. Camarilla hardliners saw this event as the sad
duty of a Camarilla Prince. Anarchs see this as the time of tyranny
where the young could be destroyed without backlash.[27]

### Belle Epoque

By this time Paris is still ruled by both the Bohemians younger faction
and the old regime elders. There is a lot of unofficial power and
influence the younger Kindred can attain. The Anarchs are scattered but
proactive on the city’s fringes.

The city is in reconstruction after the Franco-Prussian War and the
Paris Commune. The latter of which was suppressed by French President
Adolphe Thiers, earning him the Embrace into Clan Ventrue. This
backdrops provides a chance for rising new elites of the Bohemians and
elites of old guard to grasp more political influence. Adolphe is able
to stir discontent in younger Kindred and have this question the rigid
Toreador structure of Paris. He helps them gain influence through
economic institutions, trade, and urban development. These new money
Parisians are able to fight for control of the city against the older
Toreadors establishment at the expense of the poor and the Anarchs.

For the lower classes the working class and street gangs live at the end
of slums. Anarch groups and Caitiff use these fringes of society to hide
and hunt. The infamous mortal gangs *Apaches de Paris* begin to operate
in the criminal underworld. Anarchs use the gang as a tool for resources
and allow them to have a lever to disrupt Parisian society with. The
Charity Bazaar fire in 1897 is the start of the series of targets
against the Kindred Camarilla  order of Paris. The gangs engaged in
bombings, sabotage, street fights, etc. the class warfare continues to
increase tension..

At the turn of the 20th century, mortal governments acted, with
Camarilla backing. The new policies targeted the poor and gangs: turning
their slums into areas of commerce or transit. The Camarilla took it
further to target Anarchs, with the new money Kindred seeing this as a
chance to invest and gain more power. When the Great Parisian flood of
1910 destroyed the poorest districts, gang resources were destroyed
fully destabilizing the Apache gang. The Anarchs losing their power base
now go into hiding.[28]

### The World Wars

During the World War I era the Ventrue landowners and the Toreador
Bohemians kept an alliance to stand against those perceived brutes from
lower clans. This allowed them to continue to gain Camarilla
loyalists.[29]

During World War II, Paris was occupied by the Germans.[30][31]

### May 1968

Counter culture sweeps across the West in the 1960s. In May 1968,
Charles De Gaulle led post-war France; he was forced to flee Paris when
students occupied learning institutions and 11 million workers went on
strike. Issues of authoritarianism, capitalism, consumerism, and
American Imperialism spur this movement. Mirroring this in Kindred
society, the Anarchs rise up and force the Camarilla into hiding again,
and Villon to flee the city again. Feeding, debating, rioting, and such
in the barricades or on the streets. Though the movement was over so
fast, Anarchs didn’t get a chance to manipulate it like they did with
the Reign of Terror. The Camarilla returned to Paris mirroring De
Gaulle’s return.[32][33]

### Modern Nights

Sometime after the Beckoning began the Ministry met with Camarilla
officials in a Parisian hotel to negotiate entry into the Ivory Tower.
As the meeting commenced the building was bombed using a domestic attack
as cover. The Kindred assailants were never discovered, some blame the
[Banu Haqim](./banu.md),
some the
[Church of Set](./church_set.md), and many others. This pushed
[the Ministry](./ministry.md) to join the Anarchs.[34][35]

France’s
[Calcédoine](./second_inquisition.md#partner-organizations) program within DGSE has forced the
Prince into hiding as it operates throughout France and beyond.[36][37]

At some point, Aristotle de Laurent brought the sarcophagus of
[Ventrue](./ventrue.md)
Methuselah, Tiamat, to Villon's court. Many suffered memory loss of the
event and claim coffin was empty all along.[38]
