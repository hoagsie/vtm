The Circulatory System is an international blood-trafficking service for
Kindred, transporting vessels between domains with rare or sought-after
vintage. The blood they deal is exclusively mortal, though there have
been several quiet queries if they'd ever considered a more potent
source. They care little for their vessels' long-term well-being unless
it damages their profits. Many Kindred will turn a blind eye to the
issues present due to the studies the System makes possible and the new
or valuable possibilities with the Blood these studies unlock. A

## Overview

A rather new syndicate that operates via networks of logistic chains
composed of smugglers, traffickers, and profiteers. The leadership is
kept secret intentionally, and the system opaque letting only those who
need to know, know about the structure. Though they are officially
neutral, rumor has it some leadership may be influenced with factions or
even methuselahs.

Threat to their revenue or operation is met with stern threats. Hostile
actions will be met in kind. Example being their ghoul strike forces.
Usually seeking to capture over kill enemies, as their blood or vitae
can be put to market. If push comes to shove they are not above having
an operation lay low until the pressure subsides.[3]

The <a href="Ventrue" class="wikilink" title="Ventrue">Ventrue</a> are
supposedly the best customers. The organization takes notes on feeding
patterns for their clientele.[4] Bronwyn even realized the information
the syndicate collects is invaluable, but risks their reputation for
discretion if she gives too much.[5] They have different methods for
their blood sommeliers to study blood resonances and other factors.[6]

keep logistics and operations going.[8]

it breadth since the Anarch hold on Gary is fragile.[19]
