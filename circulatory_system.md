The Circulatory System is an international blood-trafficking service for
Kindred, transporting vessels between domains with rare or sought-after
vintage. The blood they deal is exclusively mortal, though there have
been several quiet queries if they'd ever considered a more potent
source. They care little for their vessels' long-term well-being unless
it damages their profits. Many Kindred will turn a blind eye to the
issues present due to the studies the System makes possible and the new
or valuable possibilities with the Blood these studies unlock. A

found the Circulatory System in

## Overview

A rather new syndicate that operates via networks of logistic chains
composed of smugglers, traffickers, and profiteers. The leadership is
kept secret intentionally, and the system opaque letting only those who
need to know, know about the structure. Though they are officially
neutral, rumor has it some leadership may be influenced with factions or
even methuselahs.

Threat to their revenue or operation is met with stern threats. Hostile
actions will be met in kind. Example being their ghoul strike forces.
Usually seeking to capture over kill enemies, as their blood or vitae
can be put to market. If push comes to shove they are not above having
an operation lay low until the pressure subsides.[3]

The [Ventrue](./ventrue.md) are
supposedly the best customers. The organization takes notes on feeding
patterns for their clientele.[4] Bronwyn even realized the information
the syndicate collects is invaluable, but risks their reputation for
discretion if she gives too much.[5] They have different methods for
their blood sommeliers to study blood resonances and other factors.[6]

**Structure**

The Circulatory System Board of Trust - Possibly the most influential
kindred in the world. They make millions with their human trafficking
operations and sell “vintages” to wealthy clientele. Their identities
are mysterious.[7]

Managers - There are managers and middlemen who report to one another to
keep logistics and operations going.[8]

Blood Runners - A seller in the
[Redwork scene](./blood_craft_scene.md) who captures vessels for the
Circulatory System. Blood resonance specialists who get people of
typical attributes and
[Resonances](./resonance.md)
for buyers.[9]

**Known Members**

Bronwyn, Malkavian - One of the founders. Owner of Blue Velvet and
informal information broker.[10]

Kyra Ripa,
[Toreador](./toreador.md) - One
of the founders. Owner of the Bliss Club in Arlington Heights. Camarilla
Hardliner and well connected Toreador. [11]

Wolfgang Goergen,
[Tremere](./tremere.md) - Board
member and oversees regional logistics.[12]

Shawn Merritt, Toreador - Low level manager manages the night club
Decadence.[13]

## Locations

Miami, Florida - Popular drug and party city for kindred, thought to be
a possible alternate origin of the Circulatory system. Former
[Sabbat](./sabbat.md) holding.[14]

[Chicago, Illinois](./chicago_ill.md) - Another suspected
birthplace of the circulatory System, as that is where two of the known
founders reside.

- Blue Velvet - A club located in downtown Chicago, popular with Kindred
  and kine. Occasionally, the Blue Velvet houses exclusive tasting
  events and blood auctions on their invite-only nights. Bronwyn has
  vessels stored underneath the club.[15][16]
- Bliss - A gothic club located in Arlington Heights, a northwest suburb
  of Chicago. Rich entertainment at Anarchs expense.[17]

[Gary, Indiana](./gary_in.md) - A transit hub used on their international network. The
Depot in the Aetna neighborhood. The Former Baron, Juggler, led attacks
on Circulatory convoys.[18] The new Baron of Gary, his childe, Felicia,
greatly dislikes the Circulatory System too, but she is cautious giving
it breadth since the Anarch hold on Gary is fragile.[19]

[Boston, Massachusetts](./boston_mass.md) -
<a href="Hazel_Iversen" class="wikilink" title="Prince Iversen">Prince
Iversen</a>’s
[Red Salon](./boston_mass.md#the-red-salons) clashes with the Circulatory System over
the market of dealing blood and vessels. The Prince considers the
options to avoid open hostilities, but the Circulatory System has
already started plans to undermine the Red Salon and spread more
influence in New England. [20][21]

Oxford, UK - The Circulatory System is a major supplier for The Penny
Dinning Club. They have contacts with the club and provide rare vessels
for their lavish dinners.[22][23]
