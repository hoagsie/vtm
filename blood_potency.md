## Overview

As time passes the kindred's blood thickens from age within the
boundaries of their
[Generation](./generation.md)'s
limit. While the stronger they become with age, there is a downside that
it will take more blood to satisfy the vampire. Kindred generally raise
Blood Potency by 1 every 100 years while active but even intense or
dangerous experiences can expedite the process. On the reverse side,
Kindred in [torpor](./torpor.md)
loses one point for every 50 years inactive. It can never rise nor lower
beyond the cap determined by their Generation.
