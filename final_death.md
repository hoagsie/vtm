Final Death is when a vampire crosses from undeath into true death and
once they reach this point they are generally unable to be brought back.
Fire, sunlight, decapitation, dismemberment, or total destruction of the
body are things that can bring Final Death. A vampire less than
one-year-old becomes a rotting corpse with those older become skeletons
or even dust. In the mechanical aspect, Final Death is generally only
met once a vampire's

filled completely and they've entered Torpor, any additional Aggravated
damage from fire, sunlight, decapitation, or total destruction of the
body will cause Final Death. [1]
