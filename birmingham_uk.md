## Overview

A major Barony of Avalon, and the UK’s second largest city. The domain
is the focus of the

class="wikilink"
title="Vampire: The Masquerade Trails of Ash and Bone">Vampire: The
Masquerade Trails of Ash and Bone</a> story, *Open Your Eyes*. Formerly
an industrial center, but has relics of the era due to changing of the
times. Though the domain is filled with contradictions in income,
residential zones, and crime. Domain said to be steeped in complacency
both for mortals and
<a href="Kindred" class="wikilink" title="Kindred">Kindred</a>. The
Anarchs haven't even pushed for a change in the city. Even court wise,
not a single position has changed hands in decades.[1][2][3]

As formerly a part of the Baronies of Avalon, the city used to send
Tribute to
<a href="London,_UK" class="wikilink" title="London">London</a> and the
city used alternative naming schemes. With the Fall of London,
Birmingham switched from the "Baron" title to the more
<a href="Camarilla" class="wikilink" title="Camarilla">Camarilla</a>
conventional "Prince" title. Though the titles of the Sheriff and
Steward positions are still called Martinet and Steward,
respectively.[4][5][6]

## History

In 1154, <a href="Mithras" class="wikilink" title="Mithras">Mithras</a>
assumed rule over the Baronies of Avalon.[51]

During the Industrial Revolution, Birmingham was a major international
manufacturing city. Kindred benefited and tried to enrich the wealth the
city brought them. The city had greatly expanded. Organized crime began
to rise as it did with many western cities in the 1920s.[52][53]

Some time after Mithras’ supposed destruction in the 1940s and the
ascension of Queen Anne as Prince of
<a href="London,_UK" class="wikilink" title="London">London</a> and the
Baronies of Avalon; Birmingham along with Manchester and Liverpool were
domains demanding more independence from London's authority. This
request had been granted with more autonomy and freedom as long as the
Traditions were upheld.[54]

In the late 20th century, the manufacturing in the city declined and the
city began to shrink. During the declining year thousands of kine left
Birmingham.[55]

In the late 1990s, the Tremere previously in the city disappeared and a
trio of Tremere, the Fates, appeared.[56]

After the 2012 attack on London, Birmingham along with other UK domains
prepared defenses as not to be surprised by similar
<a href="Second_Inquisition" class="wikilink"
title="Second Inquisition">Second Inquisition</a> attacks. Kindred
rulers across the UK took up the title “Prince”.[57][58]

## Notes

- Estelle's sire is said to be her lover, Roland Maier, but her bio say
  it is actually a Malkavian named Giona.[59][60]
