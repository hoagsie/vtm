## Overview

<section begin="summary" />

St. Louis is a major US city located in the state of Missouri. The St.
Louis domain that has been constantly warred and changed hands between
sects. Now the city looks different: street crime down, the
<a href="Second_Inquisition" class="wikilink"
title="Second Inquisition">Second Inquisition</a> considered the city
only having minimal vampiric activity, and the
<a href="Sabbat" class="wikilink" title="Sabbat">Sabbat</a> moved on
from this domain. Kindred cults still occupy the Camarilla city as
blocks of power, with the

for power, but the <a href="Church_of_Caine" class="wikilink"

The Gnostic Kindred of St. Louis have taken to placing reverence of
Caine as a top priority with an evangelical fervor. Their secret
ceremonies are filled with displays of their faith via manipulation of
flame or showing fearlessness in the face of fire. Though their
reverence of Caine aids the
<a href="Camarilla" class="wikilink" title="Camarilla">Camarilla</a> as
the Gnostics reverence for seniority; the more senior Primogen and late
Prince are thought to be deserving of all respect due to their age.[1]

## Important People and Groups

- **Chief Inspector Oubier**,
  <a href="Malkavian" class="wikilink" title="Malkavian">Malkavian</a> -
  The Chief Inspector, name for the title of Sheriff, is a brutal
  Kindred and serial
  <a href="Diablerie" class="wikilink" title="diablerist">diablerist</a>
  of
  <a href="Masquerade" class="wikilink" title="Masquerade">Masquerade</a>
  breakers. His disproportionate judgement horrified Kindred, though
  since he has the support of the Church; they shifted
  <a href="Camarilla" class="wikilink" title="Camarilla">Camarilla</a>
  and <a href="Anarch" class="wikilink" title="Anarch">Anarch</a>
  opinion in Oubier's favor. The Church argued such brutality was
  a "necessary evils” and “the will of Caine.” He possesses decent
  <a href="Blood_Potency" class="wikilink" title="Blood Potency">Blood
  Potency</a>, age, and
  <a href="Generation" class="wikilink" title="Generation">Generation</a>
  that interests the cult.[2]
- <a href="Church_of_Caine" class="wikilink"
  title="Church of Caine"><strong>Church of Caine</strong></a> - Unlike
  the other St. Louis cults the Gnostics don’t seek to rule, but to win
  the soul of the city through their zeal. While they don’t want to
  appoint a new Prince, they do want their hunting laws codified, and
  opponents of their faith destroyed; essentially seeking a spiritual
  hegemony. They are strong believers in hierarchy and are led by Bishop
  Jehoshebah. They seek to build up Oubier as a religious figure, then
  turn him into a martyr.[3]
- **Bishop Jehoshebah**,
  <a href="Lasombra" class="wikilink" title="Lasombra">Lasombra</a> -
  She claims to be from the original iteration of the Church of Caine,
  being around 900 years old. Though some doubt her age due to her story
  and higher than expected Generation. She uses her mastery of Blood to
  show her power and reasons her link to Caine is why she's immune to
  the
  <a href="Beckoning" class="wikilink" title="Beckoning">Beckoning</a>.[4]
- **Deacons and Priest** - Six Kindred work under Bishop Jehoshebah.
  They each have different aspects of the city. Their duties include
  being liaisons with Kindred factions, other Kindred cults, or mortal
  groups. They are of two approaches, the hardliners use militant means
  to spread their scripture while the others use a more soft handed
  approach taking the roles as personal guides and advisors to spread
  the word.[5]

## Locations

- **Eastern State Penitentiary** - Bishop Jehoshebah’s haven, where her
  and many of her Gnostic kin stay.[6]
- **Busch Stadium** - Notable members of the Camarilla and the Cult meet
  here. A reminder of human wealth and hubris to remind the Kindred they
  are in Hell.[7]
- **Six Flags St. Louis** - Another meeting spot for Notable Camarilla
  members and the Cult. Same reasoning as Busch Stadium.[8]
