Torpor is a state where vampires are dead to their surroundings and
reduced to the appearance of a shriveled corpse where they cannot use
[Disciplines](./disciplines.md) or react to other stimuli. This,
however, is not
[Final Death](./final_death.md) and they will wake in accordance with the time dictated by
their [Humanity](./humanity.md)
rating. The only thing that will keep them in the state of Torpor past
their Humanity rating is if they are staked, once the stake is removed
they will immediately awaken at
<a href="Hunger_system" class="wikilink" title="Hunger">Hunger</a> five.
Once the period of torpor is expired the vampire may make a test to
awaken when a potential victim is nearby, if they are successful they
will awaken to feed. They must hit Hunger 4 in order to fully awaken
from torpor. Kindred may be awoken from torpor earlier than dictated
previously by being fed enough
<a href="Vitae" class="wikilink" title="vitae">vitae</a> to stake 1
hunger from another vampire whose
[Blood Potency](./blood_potency.md) is higher than their own.

There are three ways they may enter torpor.

- Failing a
  <a href="Rouse_Check" class="wikilink" title="Rouse Check">Rouse
  Check</a> at Hunger 5 when awakening.
- Taking enough Aggravated
  [Health](./health.md) damage to
  fill their entire tracker. They will unconsciously attempt to heal 1
  point of Aggravated damage each night, if they heal all the damage
  they may wake. However, this may also put them into the torpor
  mentioned above.
- Entering this state voluntarily. During this time their hunger will
  still increase each night.[1]
