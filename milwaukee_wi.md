Camarilla. It is strongly a

## Prominent Locations

### Marquette University

The University is situated on the north end of Milwaukee and covers
several city blocks. A mysterious phenomenon known as the “Null Zone”
blankets the campus, where magic ceases to function. Once the
battlefield between Lupine, Usla, and Kindred, Chiclena, Hrothulf’s
Kindred wife. The Lupine and Kindred forces clashed. Usla called upon
spirits to destroy her enemies for great personal sacrifice; only a few
Lupine know this. Other Lupine, Kindred, and Magi study this phenomenon.
[28][29]

### The Milwaukee Art Museum

The Museum is also known as the Calatrava. It was designed by a Spanish
architect with the intent of having the building resemble a bird in
flight. Many arts pieces from different eras are hosted here. From this
location, one can see a stunning view of Lake Michigan. Once, it was the
city’s prime Elysium until Prince Decker ended the practice of neutral
ground. Small groups of Toreador or Malkavian meet here. [30]

### The Rave

A grand building that a Toreador saved from disrepair and disuse. Once a
ballroom and gymnasium, it has been converted into a modern six-tier
music venue. Two main stages, a pool area, and several bars are
amenities that have made it well known in the music community and
attracted celebrities. The
<a href="Bahari" class="wikilink" title="Bahari">Bahari</a> love coming
to this venue, especially since the Toreador owner descended into torpor
when Decker decreed no Kindred can solely own a club. [31]

### The University of Wisconsin — Milwaukee Campus

Much more accessible than Marquette to Kindred, it boasts a 24-hour
library, ballfield, and usual university amenities. The coffee house and
food court are host to a variety of students and student groups. It
attracts Kindred interested in youthful energy and the more cynical
Kindred. [32]

### Witch’s House

The city's oldest house now serves as a museum to show off the former
occupant’s statues. Urban legends surrounded the location about moving
statues being signs of misfortune. It serves as a meeting place for
Tremere and occultists. [33]

### Miller Park

Milwaukee's base park draws thousands. Popular with Kindred since games
are compatible with their nocturnal lives and Prince Decker is much more
lax on his rule of 5 or more Kindred gathering. This place is controlled
and Prince Decker often has the VIP room for meetings with other
Kindred. [34]

### The Milwaukee Chantry

Once used as an exclusive location to study the strange effects of the
Null Zone. Carna left her followers, and the two other prominent Kindred
of the chantry disappeared. The chantry is vulnerable to outsiders.
Kindred from all over try to gather any occult secret they can. It is
only a matter of time before one of the Tremere houses seeks to reclaim
it. [35]

## Important Events

Milwaukee was founded on rivalries, especially between the Lupines and
the Kindred. When some Kindred came with European settlers, the Lupine
fought. The other Kindred living among the Native population were
ambivalent to this incursion, much to the Lupine’s chagrin. The city
started as three distinct towns, but this led to civil unrest. The
unrest was manipulated by Kindred interest. This Kine and Kindred unrest
continued until the mid-1800s, when the Lupine launched a massive
coordinated attack on the city. This led Kindred to finally consider the
benefits of a unified domain. The main clans at the time were Ventrue,
Brujah, and Toreador; they reigned over the united city even as Kindred
numbers declined at the time.

Milwaukee began to grow as new citizens immigrated, and the Kindred took
advantage of the city’s segregated housing practices. The city
eventually developed a hierarchy and joined Camarilla. The first prince
was Brujah Erik Pointence. Prince Pointence ruled the city and defended
it against many Lupine attacks. He was a popular figure until he finally
succumbed to a lupine attack at the turn of the 19th’s century.

The next Prince was Merik, a Ventrue who had a less popular and
inconsistent rule. His major policy was placing the city under the
Tradition of Defense. Under such an edict, all vampires were obliged to
aid in defense of the realm. They could no longer hide or sacrifice
their rivals to the Lupines. Prince Merik and a new Gangrel named Decker
founded the Anubi, a group responsible for domain security.

In the 90s, Merik met final death either through assassination or
suicide. This left Mark Decker as the new Prince of Milwaukee. Peace was
hard to attain and many events shaped his paranoia.  The Sabbat attacks
from the north, siege after siege, he had to successfully repel. The
Gangrel and Brujah leaving the Camarilla weakened his original Anubi as
many defected to the Anarchs. Carna’s exodus weakened the Tremere clan
in the city on the eve of a Sabbat attack. Decker expanded on the
tradition of Defense with his own Decker Laws. With his Primogen Council
constantly falling victim to outside attacks and a lack of Kindred
stepping up, he dissolved the Primogen Council. Milwaukee has seen
Anarch purges and Kindred exiles under this policy, but has also never
had the SI agents infiltrate their domain, supposedly. Milwaukee is kept
in order with the Anubi, his influence of all transportation
organizations, his manipulation of law enforcement, animals, and a
series of informants. [36][37]

Even with all those measures in place, some Kindred still plan to
undermine the Prince and think the price of safety has gone too far.
With some groups meeting secretly to plot his fall.  Some even going as
far as looking at the Ministry clan’s powerbase in the Anarchs for help.
[38][39][40]

## Decker’s Law

Prince Decker has additional laws on top of the Camarilla Traditions in
the name of safety and security. Those who break these laws are often
seen branded as a coward, stripped of territory, exiled, or executed. A
summary of his laws: [41][42][43]

1\. Follow the Camarilla Traditions.

2\. Non-Camarilla Kindred are not allowed in the city without
invitation.

3\. Only Prince Decker may have influence over movement and
transportation in the city.

4\. Kindred who meet in groups larger than 5 are considered “Mobs” and
may be persecuted.

5\. No free Elysia. Only official gatherings are sanctioned by the
Camarilla.

6\. Prince and Judges must be told the whole truth and nothing but the
truth.

7\. All Milwaukee Kindred are expected to contribute to domain defense.
If not combat ready they must contribute in some other way.

8\. Any Kindred who meets Final Death for breaking these rules must
never be talked about. Those who have keepsakes of the dead may be
charged and prosecuted as co-conspirators.
