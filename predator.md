Each vampire has their preferred method; be it stalking their prey in a
dark alley or seducing a mortal to follow them into a dimly lit bathroom
at a club. What they choose will affect starting
<a href="Character_creation#Skills" class="wikilink"
title="specializations">specializations</a>,
[Disciplines](./disciplines.md),
[Merits and Flaws](./merits_flaws.md), as their experience
hunting blood shapes their skillset. When selecting a Predator type
consider what led them to take this approach, what shaped them in their
unlife or even mortal life, and into being comfortable with this style
as their methodology of quenching their thirst. As opportunities present
themselves, Kindred may attempt to change up their feeding styles even
when their instincts drive them towards a default pattern. The Attribute
and Skill combination is dependent on their approach which is guided by
the method which they pick and in some cases, Disciplines or Merits and
Flaws might also alter the pool. In an improvisational moment players
may suggest alternative pools to those suggested below. The Storyteller
is able to decide if it will work or give complications.

## Alleycat

Those who find violence to be the quickest way to get what they want
might gravitate towards this hunting style. Alleycats are a vampire who
feeds by brute force and outright attack and feeds from whomever they
can when they can. Intimidation is a route easily taken to make their
victims cower or even Dominating the victims to not report the attack or
mask it as something else entirely. [1]

Strength + Brawl is to take blood by force or threat. Wits + Streetwise
can be used to find criminals as if a vigilante figure. [2]

- Gain one specialty in either Intimidation (Stickups) or Brawl
  (Grappling)
- Gain one dot of either
  [Celerity](./celerity.md) or
  [Potence](./potence.md)
- Lose one dot of
  [Humanity](./humanity.md)
- Gain three dots of Criminal Contacts

## Bagger

Sometimes the best blood doesn't come from a live body. Baggers are
kindred who take an approach most are unable to with their ability to
consume preserved, defractionated or rancid blood through (•••) Iron
Gullet, allowing them to feed from unusual sources such as blood bags or
corpses. Perhaps they work in a hospital or blood bank or they might
even have enough knowledge about the black market to obtain their blood.
[Ventrue](./ventrue.md) are
unable to pick this Predator type. [3]

Intelligence + Streetwise can be used to find, gain access and purchase
the goods. [4]

- Gain one specialty in either Larceny (Lock Picking) or Streetwise
  (Black Market)
- Gain one dot of
  [Blood Sorcery](./blood_sorcery.md)
  ([Tremere](./tremere.md) and
  [Banu Haqim](./banu.md)
  only)[5],
  [Oblivion](./oblivion.md)
  ([Hecata](./hecata.md) only)[6],
  or
  [Obfuscate](./obfuscate.md)
- Gain the Feeding Merit (•••) Iron Gullet
- Gain an Enemy Flaw (••) of someone who believes this vampire owes them
  something or there's another reason to hunt them down

## Blood Leech

Some Kindred might see feeding from mortals as inherently wrong or
disgusting regardless of others' rationale. Blood Leech is a feeding
style that is not looked upon kindly by many vampires making it risky
unless the Kindred has a position of power and can keep their little
secret secure. Regardless, with their rejection of mortal blood, they
instead feed upon the vitae of other vampires through hunting those
weaker than them, coercion, or taking Blood as payment. [7]

This Predator Type is suggested to not be abstracted down to a dice
pool. [8]

- Gain one specialty in either Brawl (Kindred) or Stealth (Against
  Kindred)
- Gain one dot of
  [Celerity](./celerity.md) or
  [Protean](./protean.md)
- Lose one dot of
  [Humanity](./humanity.md)
- Increase blood potency by one
- Gain the Dark Secret Flaw: Diablerist (••), or the Shunned Flaw (••)
- Gain the Feeding Flaw: (••) Prey Exclusion (Mortals)

## Cleaver

The sweetest blood might be from those closest to them, the Cleaver
takes advantage of that idea while taking blood from either their own
close family and friends or even those *close to someone else*. Covertly
stealing the blood from their victims while still maintaining ties to
them. Cleavers will go to extreme lengths to keep their condition a
secret from their victims but some may instead take a less than pleasant
route. The
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md)
forbids the practice of taking a human family in this fashion, as it's a
breach waiting to happen. [9]

Manipulation + Subterfuge is used to condition the victims, socializing
with them and feeding from them without the cover being blown. [10]

This hunting style is typically rare for ancilla or older characters due
to inherent risk or becoming otherwise unsustainable over time. [11]

- Gain one specialty in either Persuasion (Gaslighting) or Subterfuge
  (Coverups)
- Gain one dot of
  [Dominate](./dominate.md) or
  [Animalism](./animalism.md)
- Gain the Dark Secret Flaw (•) Cleaver
- Gain the Herd Advantage (••)

## Consensualist

Consent is a dangerous thing to gather when they're a blood-sucking
monster, but Consensualists make do. They never feed against the
victim's free will, instead pretending to be a representative of a
charity blood drive, someone with a blood kink within the kink
community, or blatantly admitting to their victims what they are and
getting their permission to feed. To the Camarilla, the last method is
considered a masquerade breach but perhaps to a philosophical
[Anarch](./anarch.md), it might be
an acceptable risk to take. [12]

This hunting style is typically rare for ancilla or older characters due
to inherent risk or becoming otherwise unsustainable over time. [13]

Manipulation + Persuasion allows the kindred to take blood by consent,
under the guide of medical work or mutual kink. [14]

- Gain one specialty in either Medicine (Phlebotomy) or Persuasion
  (Vessels)
- Gain one dot of
  [Auspex](./auspex.md) or
  [Fortitude](./fortitude.md)
- Gain one dot of
  [Humanity](./humanity.md)
- Gain the Dark Secret Flaw: (•) Masquerade Breacher
- Gain the Feeding Flaw: (•) Prey Exclusion (Non-consenting)

## Farmer

Perhaps this vampire was once someone who worked as an activist or an
aid worker, regardless of their reasoning the Farmer only feed from
animals as their primary source of blood. The beast may gnaw at them
with its throes of hunger, but they've successfully managed to avoid
killing mortals except on the occasional bad night. Ventrue may not pick
this Predator type and it cannot be taken on characters with Blood
Potency 3 or higher. [15]

This hunting style is typically rare for ancilla or older characters due
to inherent risk or becoming otherwise unsustainable over time. [16]

Composure + Animal Ken is the roll to find and catch the chosen animal.
[17]

- Gain one specialty in either Animal Ken (specific animal) or Survival
  (Hunting)
- Gain one dot of
  [Animalism](./animalism.md)
  or [Protean](./protean.md)
- Gain one dot of
  [Humanity](./humanity.md)
- Gain the Feeding Flaw: (••) Farmer

## Osiris

More than not, Osiris are celebrities within mortal society. Musicians,
writers, priests, and even cult leaders may find an easy time finding
their blood by utilizing those already around them. They tend to feed
from their fans or worshippers which means they have easy access to
blood, but followers tend to attract their own problems with the local
authority or worse. [18]

Manipulation + Subterfuge or Intimidation + Fame are both used to feed
from the adoring fans. [19]

- Gain one specialty in either Occult (specific tradition) or
  Performance (specific entertainment field)
- Gain one dot of
  [Blood Sorcery](./blood_sorcery.md) (Tremere or Banu Haqim only)[20] or
  [Presence](./presence.md)
- Spend three dots between the Fame and Herd Backgrounds
- Spend two dots between Enemies and Mythic Flaws

## Sandman

If they never wake during the feed it never happened, right? Sandman
prefers to hunt on sleeping mortals than anyone else by using stealth or
Disciplines to feed from their victims they are rarely caught in the
act, though when they are, problems are sure to occur. Maybe they were
anti-social in life or perhaps they find the route of seduction or
violence too much for them and find comfort in the silence of this
feeding style. [21]

Dexterity + Stealth is for casing a location, breaking in and feeding
without leaving a trace. [22]

- Gain one specialty in either Medicine (Anesthetics) or Stealth
  (Break-in)
- Gain one dot of
  [Auspex](./auspex.md) or
  [Obfuscate](./obfuscate.md)
- Gain one dot of Resources

## Scene Queen

Similar to Osiris these Kindred find comfort in a particular subculture
rather than a wider audience. Hunting in or around a subculture they
likely belonged to in their previous life, their victims adore them for
their status, and those who have an inkling of what they are
disbelieved. The scene itself could be anything, from street culture to
high fashion, and the unifying trait is the use of those around them.
[23]

Manipulation + Persuasion aids in feeding from those within the
Kindred's subgroup, through conditioning and isolation to gain blood or
gaslighting or forced silence. [24]

- Gain one specialty in either Etiquette (specific scene), Leadership
  (specific scene), or Streetwise (specific scene)
- Gain one dot of
  [Dominate](./dominate.md) or
  [Potence](./potence.md)
- Gain the Fame Advantage (•)
- Gain the Contact Advantage (•)
- Gain either the Influence Flaw: (•) Disliked (outside their
  subculture) or the Feeding Flaw: (•) Prey Exclusion (a different
  subculture than theirs)

## Siren

Everyone knows that sex sells and the Siren uses this to their
advantage. Almost exclusively feeding while feigning sex or sexual
interest, they utilize Disciplines and seduction to lure away a possible
meal. Moving through clubs and one-night stands are skills they've
mastered and regardless of how sexy they feel, deep in their darkest
moments, they realize at best they are problematic and at worst a serial
sexual assaulter. In life, they might have been a scriptwriter, a small
time actor who never reached the big screen, a well-known kinkster or
even a virgin looking to make up for the lost time. [25]

Charisma + Subterfuge is how sirens feed under the guise of sexual acts.
[26]

- Gain one specialty in either Persuasion (Seduction) or Subterfuge
  (Seduction)
- Gain one dot of
  [Fortitude](./fortitude.md)
  or [Presence](./presence.md)
- Gain the Looks Merit: (••) Beautiful
- Gain the Enemy Flaw (•) A spurned lover or jealous partner

## Extortionist

*Found in <a href="Vampire:_The_Masquerade_Cults_of_the_Blood_Gods"
class="wikilink" title="Cults of the Blood God">Cults of the Blood
God</a>.* On the surface, Extortionists acquire their blood in exchange
for services such as protection, security, or surveillance. Though, for
as many times as the service might be genuine, there are many more times
when the service has been offered from fabricated information to make
the deal feel that much sweeter.

Strength/Manipulation + Intimidation to feed through coercion. [27]

- Gain one specialty in either Intimidation(Coercion) or
  Larceny(Security)
- Gain one dot of
  [Dominate](./dominate.md) or
  [Potence](./potence.md)
- Spend three dots between the Contacts and Resources Backgrounds
- Gain the Enemy Flaw (••) The police or a victim who escaped the
  character's extortion and wants revenge

## Graverobber

*Found in Cults of the Blood God.* Similar to Baggers these kindred
understand there's no good in wasting good blood, even if others cannot
consume it. Often they find themselves digging up corpses or working or
mortuaries to obtain their bodies, yet regardless of what the name
suggests, they prefer feeding from mourners at a gravesite or a
hospital. This Predator Type often requires a haven or other connections
to a church, hospital, or morgue as a way to obtain the bodies.

Resolve + Medicine for sifting through the dead for a body with blood.
Manipulation + Insight for moving among miserable mortals. [28]

- Gain one in specialty either Occult (Grave Rituals) or Medicine
  (Cadavers)
- Gain one dot of
  [Fortitude](./fortitude.md)
  or [Oblivion](./oblivion.md)
- Gain the Feeding Merit (•••) Iron Gullet
- Gain the Haven Advantage (•)
- Gain the Herd Flaw: (••) Obvious Predator

## Roadside Killer

*Found in <a href="Vampire:_The_Masquerade_Let_the_Streets_Run_Red"
class="wikilink" title="Let the Streets Run Red">Let the Streets Run
Red</a>.* These Kindred never stay in one spot for too long and are
always on the move, hunting those who won't be missed if they disappear
alongside the road. Roadside Killers know the risk is just as worth as
the reward. Perhaps this Kindred was once a truck driver themselves or
maybe they met their fate alongside the road as well.

Dexterity/Charisma + Drive to feed by picking up down and outs with no
other options. [29]

- Gain one in specialty either Survival (the road) or Investigation
  (vampire cant)
- Gain one dot of
  [Fortitude](./fortitude.md)
  or [Protean](./protean.md)
- Gain two additional dots of migrating Herd
- Gain the Feeding Flaw: Prey Exclusion (locals)

## Grim Reaper

Hunting inside hospice care facilities, assisted living homes, and other
places where those who are near death reside. Grim Reapers are
constantly on the move in an effort to locate new victims near the end
of their lives to feed from. Hunting in this style may also earn a taste
for specific diseases making them easier to identify.

Intelligence + Awareness/Medicine in order to find victims.

- Gain one specialty in either Awareness (Death) or Larceny (Forgery)
- Gain one dot of
  [Auspex](./auspex.md) or
  [Oblivion](./oblivion.md)
- Gain one dot of Allies or Influence associated with the medical
  community
- Gain one dot of
  [Humanity](./humanity.md)
- Gain the Feeding Flaw: (•) Prey Exclusion (Healthy Mortals)[30]

## Montero

Montero carry on a tradition held by aristocratic Spaniards where they
hunted deer and used teams to drive them into the huntsman. Retainers
drive the victims towards the vampire for them to feed. This is not
always done in the traditional style but in the forms of long cons,
flash mobs, or gang pursuits.

Intelligence + Stealth represents the expert planning of well-trained
Retainers. Whereas a well-practiced plan and patient waiting is
represented by Resolve + Stealth

- Gain one specialty in either Leadership (Hunting Pack) or Stealth
  (Stakeout)
- Gain one dot of
  [Dominate](./dominate.md) or
  [Obfuscate](./obfuscate.md)
- Gain two dots of Retainers
- Lose one dot of
  [Humanity](./humanity.md)[31]

## Pursuer

For those who prefer to stalk their victim, learning their habits and
routines, determining if they will cause an outcry if they disappear or
not. The Pursuer strikes when the time is right and when hunger is at a
perfect balance.

Intelligence + Investigation to locate and find a victim no one will
notice is gone. Stamina + Stealth for long stalking of unaware urban
victims.

- Gain one specialty in either Investigation (Profiling) or Stealth
  (Shadowing)
- Gain one dot of
  [Animalism](./animalism.md)
  or [Auspex](./auspex.md)
- Gain the Merit: (•) Bloodhound
- Gain one dot of Contacts from the morally flexible inhabitants where
  the vampire primarily hunts.
- Lose one dot of
  [Humanity](./humanity.md)[32]

## Trapdoor

Much like the spider, this vampire builds a nest and lures their prey
inside. Be it an amusement park, an abandoned house, or an underground
club, the victim comes to them. There the trapdoor might only play with
their mind and terrorize them, imprison them to drain them slowly, or
take a deep drink and then send them home.

Charisma + Stealth for the victims that enter expecting a fun-filled
night. Dexterity + Stealth to feed upon trespassers. Wits + Awareness +
Haven dots is used to navigate the maze of the den itself.

<!-- -->

- Gain one Haven Flaw, either (•) Creepy or (•) Haunted.[33]

## Tithe Collector

They hold enough power that other Kindred around them pay tribute in the
form of specially selected vessels, who are delivered regularly, or upon
request. The vessels must be kept in reasonable condition and returned,
but otherwise the Masquerade is everyone else's problem.

- Gain one speciality in either Intimidation (Kindred) or Leadership
  (Kindred)
- Gain one dot of
  [Dominate](./dominate.md) or
  [Presence](./presence.md)

  domain to share or a specific location within the community.
- Gain a (••) Adversary [34]
