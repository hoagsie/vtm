Factions are political groups that kindred fall into. The group they
choose to align with is determined through their agreement with their
culture, forced by their sires, or other factors contributing to which
side they select. In modern nights, there are two prominent factions,
either Camarilla or Anarch. Those who do not pick a side or join in with
smaller lesser known groups are known as Autarkis. In the fifth edition,
the [Sabbat](./sabbat.md), have
been decimated by their own actions and are an antagonistic faction left
shattered.

The Autarkis are Kindred who remain unbound to political sects, either
through refusal to allow other sects to move into their domain or by
simply refusing to align themselves to any cause but their own. Their
ambitions usually lie in protecting their own unlives or lineage, and
they care little for others. [4]

After the Family Reunion, remnants and bloodlines from the Giovanni
family and Clan Cappadocian formed the new Clan of Death, also known as
the Hecata. The arrangement was formed as a response to several ongoing
threats such as the Second Inquisition, attacks on Giovanni holdings in
Venice by the Harbingers, the release of wraiths and specters caused by
the death (or incapacitation and disappearance) of Augustus Giovanni,
and rumors of the Promise of 1528 coming to an end in 2028. They're
considered as both a 'clan of clans' or a minor sect, and are notable
for being one of the larger independent sects around in modern nights.
