\_\_TOC\_\_ **Thin-bloods** are neither entirely vampire nor mortal, the
ever changing nature of the Duskborn evokes pity, jealousy, and fear in
equal measure. Considered little more than trash by most vampires, the
thin-bloods are banding together, leveraging their resistance to
sunlight and the strange, mercurial adaptability of their powers against
their oppressors.[1]

They are clanless and not considered a clan by most Kindred, as they are
the result of
<a href="Embrace" class="wikilink" title="embraces">embraces</a> too far
from the progenitor, Caine. Created by the arrogant Kindred who believed
to be closer to the potentiator than they were, a victim of a murder and
the guilt forced the hand of a Kindred to embrace or just an experiment
of a Tremere gone wrong. The thin-bloods are a high-generation group,
often cast out and shunned by Kindred society. Viewed as a threat to the
<a href="Masquerade" class="wikilink" title="Masquerade">Masquerade</a>,
many will destroy them if given the opportunity. Thin-bloods can be of
any mortal origin and are not affected by their sire's bloodline.

In 2009 the Inner Circle of the
<a href="Camarilla" class="wikilink" title="Camarilla">Camarilla</a>
issued an edict that all Thin-bloods must be branded. A task
accomplished by a
<a href="Tremere" class="wikilink" title="Tremere">Tremere</a> tattoo
artist or even scorched into their skin using the sun. Even
<a href="Anarch" class="wikilink" title="Anarch">Anarch</a> and
<a href="Autarkis" class="wikilink" title="Autarkis">Autarkis</a> will
think twice before mingling with a branded thin-blood. [2]

Through rumors and stories, there are tales of thin-bloods finding a way
out. Even if they do not age, eventually they must decide to remain
within the night or adapt to their new lifestyle and remain in the sun.
<a href="Diablerie" class="wikilink" title="Diablerie">Diablerie</a> is
the first choice, upon taking the soul of another vampire they join
their clan and inch closer to Caine. Removing all Thin-blood traits and
characteristics as they become a fully-fledged vampire. Sometimes this
is rewarded as a prize to those who show themselves capable to the tower
and sometimes this is a spur-of-the-moment decision against a Kindred
who has been left vulnerable by others. The other choice is that of a
way out, stories of those who have returned to the sun and become mortal
once more. The stories usually entail thin-bloods clinging to their
humanity and ending their sire. But then again, any mortal who knows
about Kindred is a threat to the Masquerade and must be taken care of.
[3]

## Characteristics

Resting in the Generations from 14th to 16th, they lack the
<a href="Character_creation#Blood_Potency" class="wikilink"
title="Blood Potency">Blood Potency</a> to use most vampiric powers and
instead must use their ways to survive. Their human-like traits allow
them to take less damage from the sun and some may even walk in it
without harm. Their distance from Caine has prevented them from
succumbing to frenzies and they remain almost lifelike compared to most
vampires. However, the negatives outweigh the cost. This distance also
removes their ability to learn and master Disciplines, instead only able
to utilize them if their Blood flows with the proper
<a href="Resonance" class="wikilink" title="Resonance">Resonance</a>
from their last feed. They are also weaker than the average Kindred and
take damage as if they were still mortal. Due to their Blood Potency of
0, they cannot create
<a href="Blood_Bond" class="wikilink" title="Blood Bonds">Blood
Bonds</a> nor Embrace with any certainty, only able to ghoul a mortal
for the duration of one night with enough Blood. [4]

Thin-Bloods, unlike the rest of the clans they do hold a unique trait.
Known as Thin-blood Merits and Flaws, they can be curated by the player
to pick and choose different advantages and weaknesses unique to only
them and create the perfect almost vampire. See
<a href="Merits_and_Flaws#Thin-Blood" class="wikilink"
title="Merits and Flaws">Merits and Flaws</a>.

## Disciplines

Thin-bloods created the art of thin-blood alchemy, granting them the
potential to create new and replicate existing Disciplines from vitae
and other sources. The Merit
<a href="Merits_and_Flaws#Thin-blood_Alchemist" class="wikilink"
title="Thin-blood Alchemist">Thin-blood Alchemist</a> can be taken at
Character Creation to begin with level 1 in the Discipline and one
formulae, however, if it is not taken they can still traverse Alchemy at
the in-clan experience rate. [5]

Whenever they feed from a Resonance, they are granted one dot and one
power in a Discipline tree associated with the Resonance. If the
Resonance is Intense or stronger, they gain an additional dot in
conjunction with a second power. This, however, is only temporary as the
rating cannot be increased with experience points and is lost upon
hitting Hunger 5 or the next feeding. With the thin-blood Merit
<a href="Merits_and_Flaws#Discipline_Affinity" class="wikilink"
title="Discipline Affinity">Discipline Affinity</a>, they are able to
select one Discipline and traverse the tree as if a True Kindred.[6]

- **Thin-blood Alchemy** is created from the thin vitae only thin-bloods
  possess.

## Example archetypes

- **Live One:** Due to their closer resemblance to mortals, they are
  still deeply ingrained in the mortal world. Maintaining a family and,
  attempting to keep a job, this thin-blood strives to pay the bills
  rather than deal with a Primogen they've only heard of in passing.
- **Alchemist:** Some thin-bloods embrace their abilities rather than
  hide in the dark, this one does as much. Perfecting their art in
  private they strive to accomplish things no other alchemist let alone
  Kindred has done.
- **Redemption Seeker:** Stripped of their previous life, they seek a
  way to return to their human life. Through seeds of Golconda and
  rumors about those who have done it in the past; they seek out the
  legends detailing the steps to leave vampiric life behind.
- **Abandoned:** Being groomed for the Kindred life was something they
  experienced with their sire, or at least until that fateful night. The
  embrace went south quickly and their sire quickly did as well. Leaving
  them to take the information they had and survive.
- **Blood Chemist:** In their previous life they made designer drugs,
  sought chemical romance, or psychedelic highs. After the Embrace
  they've shifted their interest into Thin-blood Alchemy, but one food
  remains in the drug scene to keep the money flowing. [7]
- **Caretaker:** They take it upon themselves to help those in dire
  situations, they provide shelter, blood and, knowledge around their
  survival. Community and family are important to them.[8]
- **Paranormalist:** They are eager to see what else could be in the
  world, gathering information and making contact with any or all
  supernatural contactees or the supernatural themselves.[9]
- **Street Rat:** They sometimes don't even realize what they are,
  instead blaming the issues on a lousy drug trip, medical ailment left
  untreated, or a bad dream. They scavenge for trinkets for valuable
  items that could earn them some cash.[10]
- **Sun Seeker:** They don't seek too change their state, instead they
  want to develop a way to see the sun without harming their vampiric
  powers.[11]

## Notable characters

## Culture

### Kindred society

Unlike other clans they don't have a centralized organization. They do
not have shared ancestral resources to keep them safe, and lack
political capital to integrate them within Kindred society.Instead they
assemble themselves inside a domain, where the degree of organization
and amount of groups is dictated on local conditions. Nearly all cities
have at least one thin-blood soviet or gang of self-radicalized
<a href="Anarch" class="wikilink" title="Anarchs">Anarchs</a>. It's
possible one may even be recognized by the real Anarch committee in
town, but they are often isolated both politically and geographically. A
big city that has a lot of thin-bloods and a powerful
<a href="Camarilla" class="wikilink" title="Camarilla">Camarilla</a>
presence influences there to be many different small gangs and groups.
If the city is smaller with a power vacuum larger networks of Duskborn
can be created, but they will eventually split into smaller groups after
a few years. [13]

### Factional differences

Opinions often different among the Duskborn about the various sects. One
Duskborn may find themselves in good position with one or more sects,
but not every Duskborn has that same experience. [14]

#### Anarchs

Many thin-bloods took the opportunity to form relationships and seek
protections when the Anarchs pushed back against the tower and gained
the Brujah and Gangrel in their sect. The Anarchs in turn started to
work with the Duskborn more, purely out of spite to the Camarilla. If a
Duskborn is seeking protections of an organization, this is the one they
are most likely to find comfort in. A gang of thin-bloods may be able to
get Anarch standing, as a whole they have better access to Anarch
leadership than other sects. Anarchs often see themselves as the
underdogs, making them more likely to sympathize with thin-bloods.

However, the Anarchs are well versed in survival and that will override
their ideals. As many still see the Duskborn as a liability that drains
their resources while providing very little to them in way of raw power.
They accept the Duskborn more than the Camarilla, but they can count
fangs better than the Camarilla can too. Once their numbers grow too
large, they become wary of the potential influence and might call for a
purge or rumble to drop the numbers. Longer-term minded Barons will
intentionally recruit thin-bloods into dangerous coterie types. [15]

#### Camarilla

Any thin-blood that enters a Camarilla domain needs to either avoid
being detected or introduce themselves to the Prince to ask for
permission to stay. A considerable risk unless they have a
highly-specialized set of skills, or the Prince is particularly
open-minded. The only Kindred that openly have social convention or
consort with the thin-blood scum are those that have nothing to lose.
Some Malkavians and Nosferatu particularly enjoy taking a Duskborn
beneath their wing to disregard social norms, but too many of them draws
Harpy disdain and social death. Most the Mercurians keep their head,
sticking to the outskirts of the city, or stick to an unpromising domain
they have set up in. This means that the Scourge is often the Duskborn's
contact point for the Camarilla. These enforcers flip flop between being
threatening and guiding the Duskborn to remain in line with the city's
<a href="Camarilla#The_Traditions" class="wikilink"
title="traditions">traditions</a>. At best the Scourge acts as a
reluctant bully, at worst they are a violent butcher looking for an
excuse to tear them apart.

The biggest threat when operating in a Camarilla domain is the appeal of
the Ivory Tower. Unlife that lacks a support system is difficult and the
Camarilla knows that, so they can offer a great deal to a promising
Duskborn who can brew elixirs, walk in the sun, or otherwise provide a
great service. This promise of an easy unlife, and the promise of being
adopted into a real clan can be challenging for Duskborn that have given
up on curing their condition. These opportunities are rare, and the
members of a thin-blood coterie may be eager to fight each other over
the chance to join the Camarilla as a full member. [16]
