## Overview

Revenant is a term that can refer to either the infamous families of
lines of
<a href="Mortals_and_ghouls" class="wikilink" title="ghoul">ghoul</a>
who developed a natural craving for
<a href="vitae" class="wikilink" title="vitae">vitae</a> or the risen
dead composed of body parts or whole corpses due necromancy.[1][2]

## Revenant ghouls

### Origins

Revenant ghouls are made when constant ingestion of vitae alters DNA and
the ghouls procreate with each other. Those like the
<a href="Tzimisce" class="wikilink" title="Tzimisce">Tzimisce</a> did
this practice on purpose with breeding and experimentation. Others like
the <a href="Hecata" class="wikilink" title="Hecata">Hecata</a> happen
by nature of their familial culture and closeness to
<a href="Kindred" class="wikilink" title="Kindred">Kindred</a> side of
the family. There are small pockets of some that are accidents of ghouls
marrying ghouls in a small town over generations by chance.

Dhampir is an urban myth of a special kind of revenant. Said to be the
mortal offspring of a
<a href="Thin-blood" class="wikilink" title="Thin-blood">Thin-blood</a>,
if such a being is possible. Their existence is largely controversial in
Kindred societies and are said to not make it to adulthood.[3][4]

### Characteristics

Revenants are born with
<a href="Vitae" class="wikilink" title="Blood">Blood</a> addiction that
starts dormant; it can stay that way for decades or it may never
activate in some. For most, this awakens in their 20s or 30s, when this
happens they need vitae soon then will need the Blood for the rest of
their lives. If they aren't given blood they deteriorate, they have
symptoms of blood cancer, and many only survive a few months. Rumor has
it, dhampirs die in adolescence as their Blood addictions activate
earlier. When vitae is consistently supplied to the revenants, they are
unnaturally healthy, tough, and age a quarter of the rate of humans.
Their natural life span becomes 250-300 years.

Revenants can have one level 1
<a href="Disciplines" class="wikilink" title="Discipline">Discipline</a>
at start, up to 5 of such at level 1. They may learn
<a href="Blood_Sorcery_Rituals" class="wikilink"
title="Rituals">Rituals</a> or
<a href="Oblivion_Ceremonies" class="wikilink"
title="Ceremonies">Ceremonies</a>, but not
<a href="Alchemy" class="wikilink" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a>. If
dhampirs do exist, then they may access thin-blood alchemy. Revenants
can fall into
<a href="Frenzy" class="wikilink" title="Frenzy">Frenzy</a> as they have
an echo of the <a href="Beast" class="wikilink" title="Beast">Beast</a>
and may be affected by a few <a href="Compulsion" class="wikilink"

<a href="Health" class="wikilink" title="Health">Health</a> drops
dangerously low.[5]

### Known revenant families

Most families are usually lineages manipulated and affected by Kindred
creators and masters. In the past 50 years, stillborn children have
become more common and the ability to reliably create a revenant has
decreased in these families.
<a href="Sabbat" class="wikilink" title="Sabbat">Sabbat</a> aligned
families are forced to adapt or even face abandonment while other
families are in decline simply being denied continuation of their line
or the <a href="Embrace" class="wikilink" title="Embrace">Embrace</a>.
Some families exist among the
<a href="clans" class="wikilink" title="clans">clans</a> who practice
<a href="Blood_Sorcery" class="wikilink" title="Blood Sorcery">Blood
Sorcery</a> and
<a href="Protean" class="wikilink" title="Protean">Protean</a>.[6][7]

- **Bratovich** - Rural revenant family in thrall to various
  <a href="Tzimisce" class="wikilink" title="Tzimisce">Tzimisce</a> as
  famulus breeders and muscles.[8]
- **Grimaldi** - An affluent family of wealth and privilege. Branches of
  the family are free of the Sabbat and now serve
  <a href="Autarkis" class="wikilink" title="Autarkis">Autarkis</a>
  Kindred and
  <a href="Anarch" class="wikilink" title="Anarch">Anarch</a> lords.
  Some rumors even state they have contracts with the
  <a href="Hecata" class="wikilink" title="Hecata">Hecata</a> and
  <a href="Ventrue" class="wikilink" title="Ventrue">Ventrue</a> in
  exchange for vitae.[9]
- **Ducheski** - Once the scholarly Krevcheski patronized by Eastern
  European nobles. The Tzimisce subjugated them and experimented on them
  until they became revenants. They served the Dragons well, often
  making clock-work machines for their lords’ sieges and torture
  machines. When the Tzimisce warred with the
  <a href="Tremere" class="wikilink" title="Tremere">Tremere</a>, the
  Krevcheski betrayed the Dragons for the Warlocks; they took their
  modern name Ducheski. They have served the Tremere ever since as
  researchers. Since the <a href="Tremere#History" class="wikilink"
  title="fall of the Pyramid">fall of the Pyramid</a> they have been on
  hard times and in decline.[10][11]
- **La Famiglias <a href="Hecata#Bloodlines" class="wikilink"
  title="Giovanni and Rossellini">Giovanni and Rossellini</a>** - After
  years of making ghouls of their family members and tangling lines of
  marriages between different bloodline families, revenants have begun
  forming. Unlike other revenant families, they are not in decline. With
  the <a href="Hecata#The_Family_Reunion" class="wikilink"
  title="family reunion">family reunion</a>, some have gone unnoticed,
  free of a vampiric master.[12]
- **Obertus** - Originating from
  <a href="Constantinople" class="wikilink"
  title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> as a monastic line of
  ghouls. Few remain, but they have clung to their scholarly
  inclinations. They serve Tzimisce as librarians and custodians.[13]
- **Zantosa** - They are an old money family with extravagant and
  hedonistic tendencies. When they served the Tzimisce in the Sabbat
  they aided in connecting the cainites to humanity and protecting their
  master via the
  <a href="Masquerade" class="wikilink" title="Masquerade">Masquerade</a>.
  Otherwise they were left alone. They once had a great secret task but
  only Tzimisce elders in the
  <a href="Other_groups#Oradea_League" class="wikilink"
  title="Oradea League">Oradea League</a> or
  <a href="Sabbat" class="wikilink" title="Sabbat">Sabbat</a>
  remember.[14]

## The risen dead

<a href="Oblivion" class="wikilink" title="Oblivion">Oblivion</a> users,
such as the infamous
<a href="Hecata" class="wikilink" title="Hecata">Hecata</a>, can raise
the dead with <a href="Oblivion_Ceremonies" class="wikilink"
title="Oblivion Ceremonies">Oblivion Ceremonies</a>, even
<a href="Magician#Necromancer" class="wikilink"
title="mortal necromancers">mortal necromancers</a> may create similar
entities through their craft. These entities are made with corpses or
parts of corpses. They can be found in tow of their creators as spies,
security, or menial labor, but also be rogue elements. Some can be found
roaming city crypts, sewers, or even a destroyed necromancer's lab.[15]

### Examples of undead revenants

- **Homuncular Servant**  - These loyal revenants are created from
  hands, skulls, small animals, etc. They take damage as vampires and
  can stand sunlight. They are immune to mental influence and damage
  from sunlight. Most can scale walls, leap, and stealth. They are
  unable to talk or do actions with deep thought. Homuncular servants
  perceive their surroundings even if they lack ears and eyes. They can
  broadcast telepathically an image, sound, or scene back to their
  creator.[16][17]
- **Mindless Corpse** - These corpses take damage as vampires and can
  stand sunlight. They are immune to mental influence and damage from
  sunlight. They are both unable to mend. These corpses will only react
  to their creator’s directions and will not defend themselves. They can
  aid in menial tasks or follow  simple commands. They perpetually rot
  as time passes.[18][19]
- **Aggressive Corpse** - These corpses take damage as vampires and can
  stand sunlight. They are immune to mental influence and damage from
  sunlight. They are both unable to mend. These do not decay or sit idle
  like the mindless corpses, but attack anyone but their master when
  without a command. They will only rest if the vampire commands it or
  meets <a href="Final_death" class="wikilink" title="Final Death">Final
  Death</a>. They do not need ears or eyes to perceive their
  surroundings. These revenants can follow moderately complex commands
  from their creator. Their bites do aggravated damage to mortals. They
  do not decay.[20][21]
- **Flesh Golem** - A creature made of stitched together body parts of
  corpses. Even <a href="Protean#Fleshcrafting" class="wikilink"
  title="Fleshcrafting">Fleshcrafting</a> can aid if their body parts
  are still alive during stitching and it does not rot. Then a corrupted
  mock version of Kabbalistic ritual to make golems creates this
  creature. The being is soulless instead driven by shadows bound from
  <a href="the_Abyss" class="wikilink" title="the Abyss">the Abyss</a>.
  The golem has no will of its own, only its creator. The creator must
  verbally give their commands. Without a task the golem tries to kill
  anything alive. They will continue their task last given even if the
  creator is dead or destroyed. If the word of power is removed from
  their mouth, the violent shadows will escape and attack, resulting in
  the golem will fall apart.[22][23]
