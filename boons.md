## Overview

While power is the ultimate currency with the undead, one of the ways
Kindred obtain it is through the process of trading, repaying, and
incurring favors. This is known as prestation, with the favors being
called boons. Boons are promises made between two kindreds with the full
intention of repaying them. Some domains see boons as a form of credit,
with other vampires only granting boons when they already owe a boon to
someone else. The reverse is also true in other domains where owing too
many boons leaves the vampire appearing as if they are unable to pay
them off. The one unifying trait with boons, regardless of the domain,
is that there is no way to get out of what is owed and they must be paid
or excused to or by the holder.

If the holder of a boon is killed, that boon will then transfer to the
holder's sire or eldest childe in most domains. Other domains may
transfer that boon to the Prince or Harpies upon death. Claiming to hold
a boon when you do not, or defaulting and refusing to pay a boon owed
can destroy a Kindred's reputation. Between the sects, the
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md)
Harpies keep track of those who owe, some going as far as keeping
extensive lists.
[Anarchs](./anarch.md) are even a
part of the system, honoring their own to prove their lack of need for
courts and princes to retain their honor.[1]

In the cases where a coterie either has a boon or owes a debt, any
member of the coterie may call in its use or in the reverse, suffer from
the calling on upon the boon the coterie owes. [2]

## Boon levels

Below are examples of a boon’s worth. However, boons are always on a
case-by-case basis in value. A boon that is a minor boon from a neonate
may be a major boon from a fledgling. The classification of boons
depends on fulfillment ability, which can hinge on the power, the
circumstance, or the difficulty for the granter. It can also be
classified based on desperation as well, upping the ante for something
they need immediately, also known as sweetening the deal. If an example
is needed, a major boon for a neonate could be a trivial boon for a
Prince.[3]
