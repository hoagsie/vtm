Mortal blood powers the vampire's corpse, allowing them to remain active
during the nights and tap into their powers. Kindred know that it's more
than the breakdown of the blood in scientific terms and is instead
linked to some unknown essence in the blood. When Kindred find the right
victim or when they drink deep enough, they find something more, known
as Resonance. This is a tool crucial to all vampires and not just the
alchemists or blood mages who can utilize these emotions in their work.
Resonances strengthen the Kindred's powers as determined by their
[Blood Potency](./blood_potency.md) and sometimes, with the right amount of kick to it, can give
other benefits known as **Dyscrasia**.[1]

## The Resonances

The Resonances can be broken down into four main types known as
<i>Choleric, Melancholic, Phlegmatic, and Sanguine</i>. There are an
additional two types, known as "Empty" and Animal Blood.

### Choleric

The humor of passion and anger but also one of jealousy and violence.
This Resonance can, but not exclusively, be found in vessels that have
the will to fight back against whatever problems they face.[2]

- Emotions: Angry, violent, bullying, passionate or envious.
- Disciplines:
  [Celerity](./celerity.md) and
  [Potence](./potence.md).

### Melancholy

The humor of sadness and the downtrodden but also those who seek
enlightenment. This Resonance can, but not exclusively, be found in
vessels who have lost the will to fight or those who are seized by the
gain of knowledge.[3]

- Emotions: Sad, scared, depressed, intellectual, or grounded.
- Disciplines:
  [Fortitude](./fortitude.md)
  and
  [Obfuscate](./obfuscate.md).

### Phlegmatic

The humor of those who are calm and relaxed or those who are lost in
their own reminiscing. This Resonance can, but not exclusively, be found
in vessels who are at peace or can't find a reason to care at the
moment.[4]

- Emotions: Lazy, apathetic, calm, controlling, and sentimental.
- Disciplines:
  [Auspex](./auspex.md) and
  [Dominate](./dominate.md).

### Sanguine

The humor of sex and passion but also of happiness and liveliness. This
Resonance can, but not exclusively, be found in vessels who have a
sexual interest in the vampire or are simply enjoying life itself.[5]

- Emotions: Horny, happy, enthusiastic, addicted, active, and flighty.
- Disciplines:
  [Blood Sorcery](./blood_sorcery.md) and
  [Presence](./presence.md).

### "Empty"

This Resonance represents those who lack general emotions.[6]

- Emotions: That of sociopaths or the emotionally detached.
- Disciplines:
  [Oblivion](./oblivion.md).

### Animal Blood

While not a Resonance, it does serve a purpose to vampires. Giving them
access to the last two Disciplines. The Storyteller is free to correlate
animal blood to the main four Resonances, should they find it important
to their chronicle. [7]

- Emotions: None. Not tied to any emotion, simply animal blood.
- Disciplines:
  [Animalism](./animalism.md)
  and [Protean](./protean.md).

## Temperament and Dyscrasia

When a Resonance is found, it comes in three different temperaments.
These are known as: <i>fleeting, intense, and acute.</i>

As a guide, given an average population:

<td><p>16</p></td>

<tr>
<td><p>Acute</p></td>
<td><p>4</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Fleeting

Fleeting temperament is something that occurs in that moment, something
from outside stimuli has influenced this Resonance and humans with basic
emotional equilibrium experience this often. This temperament isn't
strong enough to give them a bonus, however it is enough to justify the
character purchasing dots in the Resonance's associated Discipline.

### Intense

Intense temperament indicates that the mortal has a strong tendency
towards a Resonance, perhaps it's due to past traumas or from a very
rewarding lifestyle that gives them a constant dopamine hit. With the
strength of this Resonance, characters who consume it receive a bonus of
one die towards the pools of the Resonance's associated Disciplines
which lasts until their next drink of blood or until their
<a href="Hunger_system" class="wikilink" title="Hunger">Hunger</a> hits
5.

### Acute

The acute Resonance is so intense that it contains a self-sustaining
reaction, which provides the same bonus as intense, however it also can
be taken further.

#### Dyscrasia

From acute Resonance a Kindred can find something called a Dyscrasia.
This is only able to be tapped, unless otherwise stated, through the
killing and draining of the vessel or from feeding from them over a
course of three nights. Some of these Dyscrasia effects can only be
tapped once and others can linger and be tapped on later occasion. The
effects of Dyscrasia generally only last till the next feeding or till
they reach Hunger 5.[8]
