## Overview

Many Kindred still refer to the city as
<a href="Constantinople" class="wikilink"
title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> mostly to honor the era of the
Dream and the ruler Michael, a
<a href="Toreador" class="wikilink" title="Toreador">Toreador</a>
Methuselah. That era is where the descendants of Michael the Archangel
that would eventually become the
<a href="Nephilim" class="wikilink" title="Nephilim">Nephilim</a>
originated from. The golden era ended during the sacking in the Fourth
Crusades and the diablerie of Michael by Mary the Black.[1][2] Modern
nights, the Ashirra and
<a href="Camarilla" class="wikilink" title="Camarilla">Camarilla</a>
give space to the city.[3]

The city is still fixated on the time when the Trinity ruled and The
Dream was a reality, seeing it the last time many clans lived in harmony
and contained their
<a href="Beast" class="wikilink" title="Beast">Beast</a>. The city has
had different rulers, philosophies, and polices. There is a rumor of a
new Trinity forming. Supposedly Michael stirs in Mary and Dracon takes a
new form.[4]

and still idealizes the Dream.[5] The other is Eskja “the red slipper”
Mínervudóttir, childe of a former
<a href="Toreador" class="wikilink" title="Toreador">Toreador</a> Prince

throne.[6]

The <a href="Beckoning" class="wikilink" title="Beckoning">Beckoning</a>

stricken with a vision of Michael’s will. They agreed to forge the new
era of the Nephilim.[7][8] Their first and most sacred tabernacles

Blood.[9]
