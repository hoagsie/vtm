Loresheets are specific advantages tied to a character's background
either through their lineage or their history. When looking at
loresheets the players should consider how to tie them into their
character's background and the plausibility of their implications
together with their storyteller. Some loresheets require the character
to be of a specific clan, especially Descendant loresheets, and others
require certain cults. Players are able to take a Bloodline Loresheet in
addition to a non-lineage Loresheet at Character Creation. Additionally,
Storytellers may decide that Descendant loresheets are able to count as
Bloodlines.[1][2]

<section end=summary/>

All loresheets contain a dot value from 1 to 5. Each level of a
loresheet must be bought separately, meaning that having level 3 in a
loresheet does not mean the character also has levels 1 and 2.[3]
