## Overview

<section begin=summary/>

The Church of Caine, also known as the Cainite Heresy, contains Kindred
who believe in Caine as the divine angel of God and all vampires are his
blessed children. Once an old order in the medieval ages it was thought
to be destroyed, but a new Church rises in the modern nights. They
adamantly believe vampires as not cursed, but blessed. As a vampire
explores more of their predatory nature they uncover new strength and
wisdom. A vampire must learn to control and harness the Beast.

<section end=summary/>

The Church of Caine has found itself with inroads in both the Camarilla
and the Anarch Movement, as many Kindred want to learn more about their
new nature. Once a kindred gets to know the Church better they see more
Gnostic beliefs come out, as they view Earth and its denizens as
consigned to Hell. It is the role of a vampire as a divine predator.
They reveal how they await for Caine’s return, until then they are
working on ascending the layers of hell, i.e. becoming apex predators.
The more detached a vampire is from the world and the mortals, the
closer to enlightenment a kindred is, according to the Church.

Ascendance also positions kindred overcoming their fear of fire as a
hallmark of the religion. Firewalking, handling, and staring at fire are
all activities the Church uses to train its members. This can be applied
to sunlight for more powerful kindred. The most controversial belief is
diablerie of the unworthy often to traitors or vocal enemies of other
faiths. [1]

## History

The Church of Caine was originally an arm of Gnostic Christianity in
Kindred society. It was known as the Crimson Curia to the worshiper or
the Cainite Heresy to the Church’s enemies. The Church of Caine
subverted the faith of both Kine and Kindred. They preached that Kindred
were the blessed predators with the common ancestor, Caine, who was the
divine angel of murder and had absorbed Christ’s soul. The old Church of
Caine saw it as their mission to cull the weak, dominate the Catholic
Church, and await for the third resurrection in 1239CE.

The actions inside and outside the Church drew the unwanted attention of
Catholic Inquisitors and Islamic hunters in Iberia. The hunters of both
faiths lead campaigns against the Church of Caine. The most prominent
clans of the Church of Caine were
[Lasombra](./lasombra.md),
[Banu Haqim](./banu.md),
and [Brujah](./brujah.md); saw the
Cainite Heresy as weakened. Lasombra especially ran out of patience with
the growing aberrant and rival views of the Church of Caine. The
vampires culled their clans of the Cainite Heresy by hunting down the
cultists.

The decline of the Church of Caine roughly paralleled the time when
mortal religious institutions deemed Gnosticism heresy. In Kindred
world, vampires looked to erase the legacy of the Heresy and celebrate
its downfall. The major disruption happened before the foretold 1239CE
Third coming, and was said to be burnt to the roots by the 15th
century.[2][3]

In the modern era, the reemergence of the Church of Caine is a mystery;
most of the Kindred old enough to recall the original aspects of the
Cainite Heresy would have been
[Beckoned](./beckoning.md),
[destroyed](./final_death.md),
or sunken into
[torpor](./torpor.md). Some
theories are that this new Church is a methuselah cult, but it lacks the
hallmarks and hierarchy typical in such organizations. Another is that
Caine himself revived the Church, while some Kindred claim this fact is
implausible, others find it effective at gaining recruits. There is the
third that it is simply a political landscape conducive to the Church’s
beliefs growing; [Third Anarch Revolt](./anarch.md#third-anarch-revolt) had the spiritual
Kindred view holiness stood beyond mortal religious laws, and
<a href="Gehenna" class="wikilink" title="Gehenna War">Gehenna War</a>
made many Kindred anticipate fundamental changes in society. What is
known is the Church reformed after the Beckoning and has steadily gained
more and more followers.[4][5]

While the
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md) had
strived to be a somewhat secular sect, the Gehenna War, recent
acknowledgement of antediluvians, and other upheavals have led to the
rise of religious Kindred cults due to uncertainty. The Tower had
stopped officially opposing major Kindred cults as long as they didn’t
oppose Camarilla goals. This has given the Church of Caine growing room
in the Tower, especially with some domains getting word from
[Malkavian](./malkavian.md)
Justicar, Juliet Parr, not to oppose the Church of Caine’s missionary
work. The Camarilla view of the Cainite Hersey with a mixed one. Some
Kindred see it as a front for the
[Sabbat](./sabbat.md). Other
Camarilla members see it as a more manageable alternative to the Sabbat.
Others of course see it as answers to long held questions of their
existence and role in a wider world.[6][7][8]

The [Anarch Movement](./anarch.md) has been a place the Church could slowly grow as some saw
the Camarilla as self-hating, while the Church provided answers. The
rise of [the Ministry](./ministry.md) in the Anarchs and the regrowth of the Church are thought
to have some connection.[9]

While the Church of Caine considers all Kindred from antediluvian to
[Thin-blood](./thinblood.md)
have a spark of divinity, they do not see all of them as worthy. The
Church considers those not of the 13
<a href="clans" class="wikilink" title="clans">clans</a> to be signs of
the end time and ill omens. Many
[Caitiff](./caitiff.md) and
thin-blood vampires stand opposed to the Church for such views.[10]

While in modern nights the church is far reaching, as this makes
communication difficult interpretation of doctrine is largely dependent
on the priest or church leader. Some domains may even have two Church of
Caine faction rivaling another on drastically different
interpretations.[11]

## Structure and beliefs

### Sacred Texts

**Book of Nod** - The Church of Caine holds the Book of Nod as a holy
text. They search for the fragments and turn the old stories into basis
of worship and sermons. They are a major
<a href="Noddist" class="wikilink" title="Noddist">Noddist</a>
group.[12][13]

**Euagetaematikon** - Also called the Book of Shining Blood. A text from
the old Cainite Heresy that layouts the tenets of faith and the Church's
Gnostic world view.[14]

### Sacraments

**The Sacrament of Valediction** - A kindred names their mortal fears or
new Kindred fears, and face it. This symbolic act is to promote leaving
the old life behind and accepting the Kindred life. Those who
participate and pass lower the difficulty in Terror Frenzy.[15]

**The Sacrament of Exculpation** - Once called the "Sermon of Caine",
this sacrament rite emphasis the Book of Nod and has Kindred face their
banes by showing or explaining the hardship it causes. This can reduce
the
[Bane Severity](./banes.md#bane-severity) in a Kindred for a session.[16]

**The Sacrament of Firewalking** - The emblematic rite of the cult. The
intensity increases with the vampire's prestige. The fire walk takes
place to punctuation a Cainite's worthiness for those seeking title or
acclaim. Priest sets up how it looks be it walking on coals, a fire
obstacle course, etc. When going for a leadership position the
expectation is to not give into Frenzy. This can heal Willpower for the
Gnostic.[17]

### Hierarchy

They care little for lineage or clan, their centralized power comes from
the Crimson Curia, their inner governing body composed of priests.

Congregation/The Flock - Most believers are. They can hear liturgy, but
not sacraments.

Doorkeepers - Guards of the faith. Can participate in sacraments.

Acolytes - Several duties: arranging meetings, aiding priests, and
acquiring Church Artifacts. They have firewalked at least and encourage
others to take sacraments.

Vergers - Wandering vampire who spreads the teachings. Technically hold
no official sway over the Church.

Lectors - Readers during service. They are same as acolytes, but more
trusted with this honorific title.

Deacons - Church administrator, may fill in for priest, largely deals
with business and upkeep. Above acolytes.

Priest/Church Leaders - Oversees sacraments, preaches doctrine, and
communicates with faith community. Must have once been a deacon.

Bishop - Responsible for keeping the order together and furthering Dark
Father's agenda. A select few make up the Crimson Curia. Above deacon
and priests.

The Metropolitan - Currently vacant, reserved for Caine or someone who
can channel his will. If one is appointed here they are head of the
Church.[18]

Church of Caine.[30][31]
