\_\_TOC\_\_ **Hecata** are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire:
The Masquerade. A motley collection of necromantic vampire bloodlines,
the Hecata clan are united in the pursuit of a single subject: Death.
They are students of the afterlife and resurrectionists of the dead — or
worse. Selling their services to the highest bidder, or acting in their
own interests, there are few who can hide from the surveillance of those
who can summon and command the very
[spirits](./wraith.md) of the
deceased.[1]

A clan steeped in death, they practice the arts of necromancy and
communication with the dead. The clan tends to favour mortals either
from their own mortal family or those with useful connections to other
outside families. It is speculated that the reason all Hecata share the
same Disciplines unlike their ancestors is caused by the unification of
the necromantic bloodlines that formed clan Hecata and the destruction
of so many Giovanni elders.

At Storytellers discretion, a few changes to the Discipline line up may
be made depending on the character's bloodline either through
replacement of a power with another or by offering a unique 4-dot merit
to unlock a fourth in-clan discipline. The following changes may be
made; Giovanni line may replace
[Auspex](./auspex.md) with
[Dominate](./dominate.md),
Samedi may replace Auspex with
[Obfuscate](./obfuscate.md),
Lamiae may replace Auspex with
[Potence](./potence.md) and the
Nagaraja may replace
[Fortitude](./fortitude.md)
with Dominate. Keep in mind the requirements for certain
[Amalgams](./disciplines.md#amalgams) should a player want them.[2]

With the nature of their bane, the Hecata have developed methods to feed
safely. Through blood bags and corpses or extracting blood from their
victims without the use of their fangs. They have a habit of feeding on
herds or from members of their own family, however this brings strife as
resentment and fear builds between them. In more recent years, the clan
has formed a unique bond with the
[Circulatory System](./circulatory_system.md), to obtain mute or
comatose vessels. [3]

## Disciplines

Below are the powers innate to the Hecata as well as the uses they find
in it. [4]

- **Auspex** is how the Hecata plan their moves and for this reason,
  they rarely strike on impulse.
- **Fortitude** gives them corpse-like ability to absorb harm to their
  bodies, able to shrug off anything raining down upon them.
- **Oblivion** allows them to communicate with and control the energies
  of death and of spirits. Through it's use they might question the dead
  or set them to attack a rival.

## Bane

<section begin="bane" />

**Painful Kiss** - Hecata may only take harmful drinks from mortals
which result in blood loss. Unwilling mortals that are able to escape
will make the attempt, even those who are convinced or willing must
succeed in a Stamina + Resolve test against Difficulty 2 + Bane Severity
in order to not recoil. Vampires who are willingly bit must make a
[Frenzy](./frenzy.md) test against
Difficulty 3 to avoid terror Frenzy.

<section end="bane" />

[5]

## Variant Bane

<section begin="altbane" />

**Decay** - Hecata suffer additional dots in
[Flaws](./merits_flaws.md)
equal to their Bane Severity spread as they see fit across
[Retainer](./merits_flaws.md#retainer),
[Haven](./merits_flaws.md#haven), and
[Resources](./merits_flaws.md#resources) Flaws. These Flaws can either be taken
at Character Creation or removed by paying twice the amount of
Background dots. Additionally, any purchase of dots in these Advantages
costs an additional amount of experience points equal to their Bane
Severity.

<section end="altbane" />

[6]

## Compulsion

<section begin="compulsion" />

**Morbidity** - The vampire must move something from life to death or
vice versa, any action not taken to end or resurrect something suffers a
two-dice penalty. The subject does not have to be a living thing and can
instead be an object or more abstract such as ideas or conversation
points. This Compulsion lasts until they manage to kill or return
something to life.

<section end="compulsion" />

[7]

## Bloodlines

- **La Famiglia Giovanni** - Also known as Clan Giovanni, they occupy
  the leadership role within the Hecata, though will not refer to
  themselves as Hecata outside the clan. 'La Famiglia' also contains
  other smaller families who have not earned their own bloodline yet.
- **Bankers of Dunsirn** - A family of Scottish bankers whom indulge in
  wealth, cannibalism, and family secrets.
- **Children of Tenochtitlan** - Aztec necromancers known by the
  Giovanni as the Pisanob, "ghosts of the dead that walk the Earth".
- **Samedi (Nasyon San An/Nation of Blood)** - Kindred from Baron
  Samedi's bloodline, associated with Vodou practices, along with their
  decaying flesh.
- **Flesh-Eaters** - Nagaraja whom sought after a new home within Clan
  Hecata. They're mostly known for their necromantic and cannibalistic
  prowess.
- **Harbingers of Ashur** - Remnants of Clan Cappadocian after being
  usurped by the Giovanni, captivated with the secrets of death and the
  soul. The synthesis of the Harbingers and Cappadocians.[8]
- **The Criminal Puttanesca** - A family of Sicilian mobsters known for
  their talents in crime and street hustling.
- **The Gorgons** - Remnants of the Lamia who are devoted to the Bahari
  faith, whom the curse of the Painful Kiss originates.

  Giovanni with a talent for necromancy, are known for their brutal
  exploitation of
  [wraiths](./wraith.md).

  connections to law enforcement.

## Example archetypes

- **Back Alley Doctor** - Through backhanded deals they get their blood
  from those unable to use standard medical facilities. Their skills lie
  in patching up a bullet wound to cracking the skulls of those who do
  not pay on time.
- **Fortune Teller** - The Hecata's ability to commune with the dead and
  perceive glimpses of the future makes them excellent at giving the
  living a sliver of information for a heavy price. Through guile and
  manipulation their pockets remained lined.
- **Mortuary Attendant** - Corpses are the Hecata's best friend. Their
  time in life prepared them for this job and now this job is the only
  thing feeding them in adversarial nights.
- **Crime Scene Cleaner** - Trinkets are the like are easy found at the
  scene of a crime, this Hecata has taken advantage of that fact. Able
  to take items to summon spirits they unravel the stories of what truly
  happened at a brutal murder scene.

## Notable characters

**<a href="Roger_de_Camden" class="wikilink" title="Roger de Camden">Roger
de Camden</a>** - One of the oldest and most mysterious Kindred in the
Clan of Death. In his life he was many things, a scholar, necromancer,
and survivor. Originally English-born after his embrace into the
Cappadocians he traveled all over to learn more of the clan's craft. He
turned to his native England when he heard of the ancient Kindred
Mithras' presence. The two grew close becoming his Seneschal and secret
lover. When the Giovanni began to hunt members of the bloodline, he used
powerful necromancy to fake his death. He took on a new identity, Pater
Thomas, to lead the cult of Mithras from London to Edinburgh. After
being used as bait to seemingly end Mithras, Roger's identity has been
revealed. Currently the elder has joined the Hecata, rules Edinburgh as
Prince, and runs the Cult of Mithras as he waits for the
[Ventrue](./ventrue.md) to
return.[9][10][11]

**Augustus Giovanni** - Formerly the leader of the Giovanni. The head of
a Venetian merchant and necormancer family, the antediluvian,
Cappadocious, embraced him. Over time Augustus led the coup to
diablerize the clan founder, Cappadocious, and usurp the Cappadocians
for his line. He led family in a campaign to expand, collect spirits,
and destroy the old Clan of Death. Soon discontent with his rule led to
a revolt the has supposedly led to his Final Death or exile. The
Giovanni now helped form the Hecata, with bloodline he once wanted
destroyed.[12]

**Mora the Death Seer** - A mysterious Harbinger, who feigned acceptance
of the Family Reunion. They had murdered many members of the Family in
times past, but seemed to want to make amends. This was a ruse for them
to get close to their enemy and strike. They leave a Honeysuckle twig in
the ashes of those slain. They lead a faction to help carry out their
work.[13][14][15]

## Culture

### Embrace

The clan tends to favor mortals either from their own mortal family or
those with useful connections outside of the families. There is a
preference for those able to withstand death, either through mortals who
have faced it dead on or caused it. As well as those who worked in the
fields of medical or occult. Little need is found in those who hold
compassion or empathy unless used to close a gap in the clan.
Graverobbers embrace those willing to do whatever it takes for the good
of their family or community. To them, family comes first even if you
are not a Giovanni by name. It is seen as giving the most exceptional
person the most exclusive family houses.

Spontaneous Embraces are generally frowned upon, as they tend to prefer
a more ritualistic approach of watching and grooming would be
<a href="Childe" class="wikilink" title="childer">childer</a> before
casting their opinion on their worthiness. Each new addition is usually
carefully selected and adds something to the clan, with them seeking to
serve the family and expand its interest. With no other true
independents in these nights, the Hecata are alone against everyone
else.

Criminal kingpins, the self motivated, those who have seen death,
occultists, medical professionals, all have things that can attract any
branch of the Hecata and sees them as candidates for
<a href="Embrace" class="wikilink" title="Embrace">Embrace</a>.
Knowledge of death is also sought after, those with academic,
scientific, or religious experience in death or the afterlife are
approached. Of course criminals are appealing, from con artists, to
professional killers, to crooked money launderers all do much to pique
the interest of the clan. Fledglings and neonates usually take to expand
the family’s interest or research new mysteries into the cycle of life
and death.[16]

### Structure

The Hecata have adapted the Giovanni structure, but largely names, ranks
and organization depends on families and culture on a local level of
each domain. Unlike the Camarilla, the Hecata usually focus over areas
of expertise rather than praxis or location.[17]

#### The Anziani Council

The ruling body of the organization who set policy and goals for the
Hecata. They convene in a place called the Mausoleum in Venice. In
modern night, they are composed of the most influential and brilliant
necromancer. The Anziani is the collective name for the many groups
within that allow the Hecata to function on an international scale.
Hecata members tend to call getting the Anziani’s notice and rising in
rank “climbing the Venetian Ladder” as they tend to aim to be in the
upper echelons of the family.[18]

#### 1444 Chamber

This inner council used to be Augustus Giovanni’s most powerful
advisors. Currently they are the leaders of the clan and who sponsored
both the Family Reunion and Capuchin upon their growing frustration with
Augustus management. Most old Giovanni loyal to Augustus were destroyed
and replaced by new members either talents from the Family or a powerful
member of a newly joined bloodline. The members are mysterious, but they
are the final arbiters of the Hecata.[19][20]

### Outside the Reunion

There are some bloodlines who are indifferent or have rejected the
Family Reunion. They may act as free agents or even hostile to the
Hecata.[21][22]

#### Mora’s Death Seers

This group still hold their cousins still responsible for past crimes. A
faction of Harbingers led by Mora. The group seeks to travel the world
and end the Giovanni bloodline and destroy Hecata of note. Mora claims
to have the backing of a methuselah called Unre. The Clan of Death does
their best to suppress actions and knowledge of his faction and others
like it.[23]

## History

### Original Clan of Death

The Cappadocians were the original holders of the title Clan of Death.
Cappadocius was the clan founder and leader. They were known for their
roles as advisors, scholars, and saboteurs with Lamia as a branch family
who operated as bodyguards. The Cappadocians had long been allies with
[Ventrue](./ventrue.md) and other
founding
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md)
clans. In 1444 the Cappadocians inducted the Giovanni into the clan to
expand their influence. The Giovanni were known as a family of Venetian
merchants and necromancers whose craft traced back to Roman era, when
they were known as Jovians. At a certain point, Cappadocius locked away
a portion of the clan he considered failures under Kaymakli, to seal
them forever. This event is known as the Feast of the Folly. Some
Cappadocians didn’t heed the invitation and others escaped by traveling
into
[the Underworld](./underworld.md) led by Capuchin. Those who survive via the latter had
their faces marred by their time in the
[Shadowlands](./underworld.md) becoming Harbingers bloodline,
sometimes called Harbingers of the Skull.[24][25]

### Rise of Giovanni

The Giovanni upon seeing the antediluvians' actions grew nervous and
plotted a coup. This branch soon had their leader, Augustus Giovanni,
destroy Cappadocius and lead to the newly formed Clan Giovanni. Their
first act was purging the Cappadocians and destroying their Lamia
protectors. Many surviving Cappadocians and Harbingers went to the
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md) for
help, but were shocked when the fledgling Camarilla cut a deal with the
Giovanni. Camarilla not wanting a two front war with the Giovanni and
[Sabbat](./sabbat.md), the
Camarilla brokered a deal. The Giovanni were fully seen as the new Clan
of Death with the Promise of 1528 signed between Clan Giovanni and the
Camarilla. The Promise declared non-aggression and allowed the Giovanni
to continue their hunt for Cappadocians. Augustus' grand plan was called
Endless Night, a goal to tear down the barrier between the world of the
living and
[the Underworld](./underworld.md).[26][27]

Some Harbingers fled to the Sabbat to punish the Giovanni and Camarilla,
others retreated back to the Underworld. The many of the surviving
Cappadocians who didn’t attend the Feast of the Folly, simply went into
hiding and kept low profiles.[28] The Giovanni held on to their newfound
control by fortifying themselves and spreading their influence; the
Giovanni had supposedly succeeded in slaying all of the Lamia at this
time. The Giovanni started to Embrace other prominent families to enrich
the clan: the Rossellini in the 16th century, then the Sicilian-based
Puttancesca, then the Dunsirn, Milliners, and others, each provided a
useful connection in either finances, politics or dark arts and a foot
hold on most of the continents around the world.[29]

During the Haitian Revolution a vodou secret society appealed to their
gods for power and met a powerful being, others say they captured a
vampire; either case the Samedi or Nasyon San an, as they call
themselves, were born. They are led by master necromancer, Doc San,
often mistaken for Baron Samedi by outsiders. Their influence spread in
the Caribbean and often worked with
[Ministry](./ministry.md)
vampires.[30][31]

### The Family Reunion

In the modern night the Harbingers, Cappadocians, Nasyon san an, and
dissidents of other death bloodlines started secret communication with
young disenfranchised or frustrated Giovanni members. The rumor that the
Promise of 1528 was only a 500 year agreement further led to worry over
Camarilla retaliation and Augustus' poor management. This led to an
attack on Augustus and his Venetian holdings snowballing into a revolt
against the elders of Clan Giovanni, and assassinations of high profile
clan members. Some rumor speak of the successful assassinated Augustus
Giovanni, others say Augustus is perpetually on the run. An unforeseen
consequence was all the
[ghosts](./wraith.md) under
Augustus’ thrall were released. The Giovanni and all the bloodlines
found themself besieged with legions of ghosts that have been enslaved
for centuries.[32][33]

This led to the formation of the Hecata, a tenuous alliance, often
called the Family Reunion. Capuchin became a very prominent leader; The
Anziani Council is what sets the clan directives with their inner group,
1444 Chamber, being the mysterious, most prominent council who are the
final judges of clan matters. On local levels the Hecata push to
increase their influence, solidify this alliance of bloodlines, and
deepen their influence of death.[34]
