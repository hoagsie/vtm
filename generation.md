## Overview

Generation is the distance between a kindred and the first vampire,
following their
<a href="Embrace" class="wikilink" title="Embrace">Embrace</a> a newly
formed vampire is one number higher than their sire. The only act which
can lower this is known as
<a href="diablerie" class="wikilink" title="diablerie">diablerie</a>.
Generation, however, does not dictate the age of a vampire, as a 10th
Generation vampire could have been embraced hundreds of years ago and in
reverse, a low Generation vampire could have embraced a fledgling in the
last year.

### Sea of Time

Players and storytellers may decide the coterie’s age range during
<a href="character_creation" class="wikilink"
title="character creation">character creation</a>. The default age range
is childer, but they group may agree to play an older coterie. The
Generation helps decide the starting
<a href="Blood_Potency" class="wikilink" title="Blood Potency">Blood
Potency</a>.[1][2]

### Sea of Time for older SPCs

If a storyteller wishes to have older SPCs these are the general
guidelines.[3]

### Caine and the Second Generation

<a href="Caine" class="wikilink" title="Caine">Caine</a> and perhaps
<a href="Lilith" class="wikilink" title="Lilith">Lilith</a> for those
who believe in these myths were perhaps the first vampires. However,
anything could have happened on those first nights.

### 3rd Generation

Also known as the Antediluvians, they are the founders of the 13 clans
and are thought to either be dead or asleep for the past thousand years.
However, the <a href="Sabbat" class="wikilink" title="Sabbat">Sabbat</a>
have declared war against them declaring war and beginning the
<a href="Gehenna" class="wikilink" title="Gehenna">Gehenna</a> which has
roused the long-lost vampires and caused the
<a href="Beckoning" class="wikilink" title="Beckoning">Beckoning</a>.

### 4th and 5th Generations

Also known as the Methuselahs and are nearly as powerful as the
Antediluvians, however, they retreated from
<a href="The_Jyhad" class="wikilink" title="The Jyhad">The Jyhad</a> and
most remain asleep beneath human cities.

### 6th through 9th Generations

The elders were mostly Embraced before the modern age and held
<a href="Domain" class="wikilink" title="Domains">Domains</a> within the
<a href="Camarilla" class="wikilink" title="Camarilla">Camarilla</a> and
<a href="Anarch" class="wikilink" title="Anarch">Anarch</a> Movement for
generations. However, most are called to the Beckoning these nights and
only a few hold out against this calling.

### 10th and 11th Generations

These are the ancillae and are the lowest generation for player
characters.

### 12th and 13th Generations

The neonates are a generation between the ancilla and fledglings with
little experience with the curses of vampirism, but however, understand
the technology and societal changes better than those older than them.
Sometimes they are blamed for the recent explosion of uprisings within
the Anarch Movement. This generation also contains the fledglings of the
modern night, those new to the vampiric life.

### 14th through 16th Generations

<a href="Thin-blood" class="wikilink"
title="Thin-bloods">Thin-bloods</a> are the furthest from the
progenitors, thought to be the bringers of Gehenna by those who believe
in The Book of Nod.[4]

## Effects of Generation in Play

- Vampires with lower generation can spend a
  <a href="willpower" class="wikilink" title="willpower">willpower</a>
  point to completely negate
  <a href="Dominate" class="wikilink" title="Dominate">Dominate</a> from
  a higher (weaker) generation vampire.[5]
- If a higher generation vampire diablerizes a lower generation vampire,
  then the attacker’s generation lowers by one.
- After diablerie, the black veins stay in the attackers aura for each
  generation difference in years if the diablerist had a higher
  generation.[6]
- Generation affects the Blood Potency's ceiling and base level.[7]
