## Overview

<section begin=summary/>

The Ashfinders are a cult built up primarily by
[thin-blood](./thinblood.md)
who utilize social media to revel in unlife's greatest pleasures and in
doing so strike back at the elders who oppress them. Within this cult,
they've also found a way to cultivate their powers and gain strength
without needing diablerie. This cult was built in reaction to the desire
to survive and the disenchantment they faced with the political
factions. While there may be Kindred who understand or sympathize with
the struggles of the thin-bloods, this cult is seen as a threat to
vampiric society. Ashfinder ranks are primarily thin-bloods, however,
there are a few true Kindred who support them and, those that do tend to
have [Anarch](./anarch.md) leaning
tendencies.

With the aid of a Tremere vampire known as Dr. Mortius, the thin-blood
were given thaumaturgical ability and information in trade for their
Ashe. The Ashe is a drug created from vampire remains using the
necromantic side of
[Oblivion](./oblivion.md),
<a href="Thin-blood_Alchemy" class="wikilink"
title="Thin-blood Alchemy">Thin-blood Alchemy</a>, and
[Blood Sorcery](./blood_sorcery.md) combined to consume the shattered remains of the Beast. This
drug can be consumed however one prefers, whether eaten, injected,
snorted, or rubbed into the skin. Ashe allows them to share the
memories, abilities, and [Disciplines](./disciplines.md) of dead Kindred, all blended
together in a euphoric experience. Rumors exist that the drug might
offer a brief reprieve from the ever-gnawing Hunger the undead face. The
drug itself is highly addictive with dangerous side effects if taken in
excess. With the withdrawal of the drug, some are pushed to hunt other
vampires to obtain their next fix. Still, the Ashfinders are flooding
the party scenes and offering its recipe to anyone who asks.

Due to their use of vampiric remains and the powers they may possess
when consumed, this cult is feared by the Camarilla and others who honor
their ancestors. The spread of this drug and its utilization has created
fear within other Kindred, especially when factoring in that it has no
effect on those who are not thin-bloods. [2]
