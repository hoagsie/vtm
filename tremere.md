**Tremere** are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The
Masquerade. The arcane Clan Tremere were once a house of mortal
<a href="Magician" class="wikilink" title="mages">mages</a> who sought
immortality but found only undeath. As vampires, they’ve perfected ways
to bend their own Blood to their will, employing their sorceries to
master and ensorcel both the mortal and vampire world. Their power makes
them valuable, but few vampires trust their scheming ways.[1]

## Disciplines

Below are the powers innate to the Tremere as well as the uses they find
in it.[2]

- **Auspex** allows the Tremere to perceive the truth from their
  surroundings, hunting down hidden objects and communicate long
  distances with others without fear of being heard. When in a pinch
  they use this power to find a pliable victim to feed from.
- **Dominate** gives the Warlocks the ability to do anything for
  knowledge and get away with it. Theft, betrayal, and anything else
  with lesser ethics are easily covered by manipulating the minds of
  others. They show little remorse when using this power to feed as well
  when needed.
- **Blood Sorcery** grants them the ability to release devastating
  attacks against their foes, protecting themselves in turn and ease
  feeding. Some Thaumaturgy uses this power to sap the blood from a
  mortal's body without physical touch. This expertise in unlocking the
  secrets of blood makes them a valued if not mistrusted member of the
  Camarilla.

## Bane

<section begin="bane" />

**Deficient Blood** - Before the fall of Vienna, they were defined by
their rigid hierarchy of Blood Bonds within the Pyramid. After the fall,
their Blood weakened and rejected all prior connections. Tremere are
unable to Blood Bond other Kindred, though they can still be Bound by
other clans. Tremere can still Blood Bond mortals to do their bidding,
but their corrupted vitae must be drunk an additional amount of times
equal to their Bane Severity.

## Variant Bane

<section begin="altbane" />

**Stolen Blood** - When performing a Blood Surge they need to make Rouse
Checks equal to their Bane Severity. If these Rouse Checks increase
their Hunger to 5 or higher, they can choose whether to back off their
Blood Surge or perform it to then hit Hunger 5 afterward immediately.

<section end="altbane" />

[4]

## Compulsion

<section begin="compulsion" />

**Perfectionism** - Nothing but the best will satisfy them, anything
less than exceptional still instills a profound sense of failure. When
afflicted by this, the Warlock suffers a two-dice penalty to all dice
pools. The penalty is reduced to one die when actions are being repeated
and removed entirely on a second repeat. This does not end till they
managed to score a critical win on a Skill roll or the scene ends.

## Example archetypes

- **Determined Scholar** - Their desire for power is never quenched as
  they undertake any task regardless of its peril to seek out scraps of
  information.
- **Witchcraft Expert** - Embraced for their skill in mortal occult,
  this knowledge has only grown as the Kindred attempts to push their
  Blood Sorcery beyond its normal limits.
- **Eternal Detective** - While knowledge is their goal, they find
  helping others unravel their mysteries to be their true purpose.
  Perhaps a detective once in life, they now run their own business to
  continue to work for other Kindred.
- **Niche Podcaster** - When other Kindred may prefer to hide in the
  shadows, this Kindred works to build a cult of personality online.
  Dabbling in their dark arts using the mortals who have shown true
  devotion to them.

## Culture

### History

Tremere was once the name of an eight-century Romanian hermetic
<a href="Magician" class="wikilink" title="mage">mage</a>, obsessed with
knowledge and power. This obsession allowed him to prolong his lifespan
beyond the mortal timeframe, but eventually, his power weakened, and in
turn, he became unwilling to accept his mortality. From his greed, he
instigated terrifying magical experiments which damned him and his
followers. Thousands of mortals and hundreds of Kindreds were murdered
in the experimentation and ritualistic practices to find the elixir of
life. These actions eventually unveiled the curse of Caine, entering him
and his followers into an eternity of unlife and hunger, unable to use
practice their craft. Tremere and followers were able to use
[Blood Sorcery](./blood_sorcery.md) to imitate their old magic and organized their newly turned
clan. The Tremere were once possibly the most organized clan by virtue
of their Pyramid, a strict hierarchy with the
[Blood Bond](./blood_bond.md)
and oaths enforcing loyalty so power was concentrated at the top and
trickled down. They had ranks and chantries who all answered to the
Council of Seven, who sat atop the Pyramid.

In 2008 the Prime Chantry in Vienna was destroyed by the
[Second Inquisition](./second_inquisition.md), and their ability to
Blood Bond dissolved, it knocked them from their powerful status to
unwelcome Kindred. The Usurpers had few friends from the arrogance of
their Pyramid, still, the need for their Blood Sorcery hasn't
disappeared. Without the Pyramid, the Tremere lack the structure and
organization they once had, now competing with other Kindred and their
clan to claim a foothold and regain some of their former glory. Their
desire to collect the remains from the Chantry rival the ugliness seen
within the Camarilla and is often used as a weapon between the remaining
Tremere houses.

The remaining Warlocks serve in three ways; either to other clans with
their occult knowledge, the Camarilla with Blood Sorcery, or, themselves
to grasp at power. Even if they've shifted more towards the practice of
their art rather than the theory of it, they still claim fewer thrones
than the
[Nosferatu](./nosferatu.md).
The reality is that most do not see a need to become Prince unless it
serves to further their knowledge as to most, power is the knowledge of
how to shape the world to their will and access to the rarest of ancient
artifacts. Misguided by their greed for knowledge, most keep their
secrets hidden from their coteries and even their clanmates. However,
Kindred seeking knowledge of their history will do well to approach the
Tremere for answers. As long as they are at peace with knowing that
they'll need to share some of their secrets, knowingly or not.[10][11]
Many warlocks are active on the
[blood craft scene](./blood_craft_scene.md), searching for
knowledge, scrounging for ingredients, or leveraging their blood sorcery
for profit. Some seek what was lost and other seek to build something
new.[12]

### Houses

Though the Tremere have fractured into factions, there are three that
strive to have some sense of overall clan unity: House Carna, House
Goratrix, and House Tremere. This does not eliminate their rivalry with
one another nor the smaller factions and Tremere mercenaries who want to
go their own path.[13]

#### House Tremere

The main house of Clan Tremere is led by Karl Schrekt. They remain
aligned to the Camarilla sect and loyal to the Pyramid with their
traditions.[14] They are still secretive with their knowledge and have
high standards for embrace. They usually embrace from Intellectuals,
academia, occultists, and whoever they believe are worthy of the Blood.
This House keeps the previous organization with standardized feeding
practices and even a new Council of Seven. Under each Council member are
seven Pontifex who oversee wider operations of a specific field. Head of
Chantry is a Regent under them are the apprentices.[15][16] The
<a href="Praesidium" class="wikilink" title="Praesidium">Praesidium</a>
is a militant sub-faction and cult  within House Tremere who work to
undermine the other major houses and and House Ipsissimus with aims to
restore the Pyramid.[17]

#### House Carna

Followers of Carna may also be called Witches, Blood Witches, or
Carnines.[18][19] A splinter cell created by Carna herself looking to
separate herself and her followers from the Blood Bonds of the Pyramid.
After the fall of the Pyramid, this group attracts many Anarchs and
disenfranchised Camarilla members. In the modern age, she pushes for the
modernization and feminization of Clan Tremere. While they are
officially Camarilla aligned, they do have
[Anarch](./anarch.md) leanings.
Those embraced in this house are usually unorthodox by old Pyramid
standards: pagans, psychics, and chaos magicians. The House serves a
cult of personality as a kink-forward, blood bond-like ritual ties the
participants to Carna.[20] [21] Their mission is to expand the research
on Blood Sorcery. To this end, the Witches have explored Thin-Blood
Alchemy, mortal Wiccans, and reach for a new unified theory of magic.
The House hazards angering other supernatural creature’s with their
meddling, but they have found some successes that push their pursuit
on.[22]

#### House Goratrix

A cultish Tremere house lead by Goratrix and previously apart of the
Sabbat, joining the Camarilla in modern nights.[23] Followers are called
Goratricine, Goratrero in South America, and Goratajo disdainfully by
outsiders. They are sometimes called traditionalists by other blood
sorcerers. The one giving directives to their followers is assumed to
Goratrix or someone skillful in Blood sorcery. The structure currently
has breaks in communication, but this house aims to rebuild the Pyramid
using Dominate, Presence, and strict obedience in absence of Blood
Bonds. They are willing to buy nearly anything for their goal. They
spread influence through occult favor, pulling old court debts, and
recruiting new warlocks with seemingly promising terms. Once in the
House it becomes apparent they micromanage their members’ unlives: be it
feeding, finances, or whatever in name of chantry good. The overbearing
nature of this house scares many would be recruits away. They must make
calculated shows of strength to prove their legitimacy.[24]

#### House Ipsissimus

A faction the Tremere, existing within the
[Anarch](./anarch.md) sect after
the fall of the Pyramid. Now free from their bonds of enslavement, they
strive to find perfect balance in all things in order to reach
enlightenment.[25] They are a well known example Solitarchies keeping to
street level politics or marketeers for new magic. Though their presents
and persistence in the Anarchs make them a House of notices, especially
by the Presidium.[26][27]

#### Solitarchies

Any other Tremere chantry that operates outside of one of the three
major Houses regardless of sect.[28] When the Prime Chantry fell, some
chantry leaders continued to operate, having the foresight to not solely
rely on the blood bond for loyalty. These Tremere enclaves develop
either by choice or through necessity of losing their main body. Some
have even fallen into more radical organizations and research topics
without the Pyramid leaders to give them directives or monitor their
research.[29]
