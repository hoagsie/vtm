Mortals are human beings which the world is designed for and are
generally unaware of the supernatural world surrounding them. They are
the pawns of Kindred, the source of sustenance for others, and in some
cases antagonists. Ghouls are mortal as well however they've been given
the opportunity to drink a vampire's vitae and in turn gain some
supernatural traits.

## Overview

Mortals are the people that inhabit the world that vampires lurk in, the
people that society is built for as technology continues to advance and
brings them closer together. They have an endless amount of resources
thanks to this, making living as vampires that much harder. Their
airports scan luggage with the ability to notice that there might be a
corpse in that shipping container and not what the manifest listed, they
are connected through social media and other platforms to share
information and perhaps rally against the creatures in the night.
Mortals serve as a key element in World of Darkness and using them as a
focus in stories, about their lives and who they are, can amplify the
aspect of personal horror for players. Many Kindred, either through a
spiralling
[Humanity](./humanity.md), a
naivety, or something else see them as nothing more than food to be
preyed upon and when they do create relationships with mortals, they are
the ones who set the terms.[1]

From the moment a mortal drinks the vitae of a vampire they become a
ghoul, starting a process that simultaneously makes them more and less
than they originally were. Ghouls are often taken as
[retainers](./merits_flaws.md#retainers) in cases where their loyalty is required
regardless of the
<a href="Masquerade" class="wikilink" title="Masquerade">Masquerade</a>,
especially as Kindred can
[Blood Bond](./blood_bond.md)
as many ghouls as they can effectively manage. Unlike the vitae used in
the <a href="Embrace" class="wikilink" title="Embrace">Embrace</a> or
Blood Bonds, the Blood retains its ability to ghoul a mortal when stored
for a few days in an airtight container away from sunlight.

One <a href="Rouse_Check" class="wikilink" title="Rouse Check">Rouse
Check</a> worth of vitae grants the mortal, or animal, the following
benefits for roughly one month.

- The mortal gains the first dot of a
  [Discipline](./disciplines.md)
  known by the vampire, called a domitor, and then one level 1 power
  from that discipline.
- If a ghoul uses a power that costs a rouse check, they instead will
  take 1 point of Aggravated
  [Health](./health.md) damage
  rather than making the Rouse Check.
- Their aging process stops, sometimes even bringing the clock back a
  few years.
- Wounds heal twice as fast, unless caused by fire.

But be warned that when weaning a mortal off this Blood, besides the
side effects of the possible withdrawal from it's euphoric rush, that
the years lost from the aging process being stopped will catch up to the
mortal and rapidly deteriorate them. [2]

## Creating a mortal player character

When creating a mortal character to be a player character there are a
few options, most notably creating a character that represents a
vampire's
<a href="Touchstone" class="wikilink" title="Touchstone">Touchstone</a>,
other merits such as the ghouled retainer are also an option, or even
simply a mortal in the process of being groomed for the Embrace.

The process to creating a mortal character is very similar to the
<a href="Character_creation" class="wikilink"
title="creation">creation</a> of a vampire, with a few differences that
are noted below.

- Mortals do not have a
  <a href="Clans" class="wikilink" title="clan">clan</a> or sire, though
  they can be gained in play.
- Mortals do not have <a href="Predator_types" class="wikilink"
  title="Predator types">Predator types</a>, and only ghouls have
  Disciplines as described above.
- With Advantages and Flaws, mortals are limited in those that they can
  take however they do have specific
  [Flaws](./merits_flaws.md#ghouls-and-mortals) they may access. Ghouls also have specific
  [Merits and Flaws](./merits_flaws.md#ghouls) they may access. Mortals
  are unable to take [Archaic](./merits_flaws.md#archaic),
  [Feeding](./merits_flaws.md#feeding),
  [Herd](./merits_flaws.md#herd),
  [Mythic](./merits_flaws.md#mythic),
  [Status](./merits_flaws.md#status),
  [thin-blood](./merits_flaws.md#thin-blood),
  <a href="Coterie_Backgrounds_and_Merits" class="wikilink"
  title="Domain">Domain</a>, or other vampiric or supernaturally leaning
  traits. They can take
  [Haven](./merits_flaws.md#haven) even if they wouldn't call it by that name.
- Kindred-exclusive
  [Loresheets](./loresheets.md)
  may not grant them any mechanical benefit, but players are encouraged
  to work with their <a href="Storyteller" class="wikilink"
  title="Storyteller">Storyteller</a> to ensure that a character with
  vampiric-specfic Loresheet knowledge would fit within the chronicle.
- Mortals still select one to three
  <a href="Conviction" class="wikilink"
  title="Convictions">Convictions</a> and Touchstones as a vampire
  would, though their connection to the Touchstone would be more
  immediate and personal as they still live within mortal society.
  Mortals begin their
  [Humanity](./humanity.md)
  rating at 7.[3]
