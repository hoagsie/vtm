There are many other groups and factions with their own desires and
motivations. While nowhere near the same size or power as the
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md) or
the [Anarch Movement](./anarch.md), they can still have an impact on Kindred Society.

## Blood Sigils

The various groups in Blood Sigils are focused on the
[Blood Craft scene](./blood_craft_scene.md), either through
[Blood Sorcery](./blood_sorcery.md) or <a href="Thin-blood_Alchemy" class="wikilink"
title="Thin-blood Alchemy">Thin-blood Alchemy</a>.

### The Almost Assembly

A loose network of thin-blood pursuing evolution through alchemy. They
are more science-minded in their pursuits.[1] They focus not on
returning to humanity,
<a href="Golconda" class="wikilink" title="Golconda">Golconda</a>, or
[diablerie](./diablerie.md) to
be true Kindred, but rather a true state of immortality as Neo-Humans.
They are technocratic, secretive, and passionate. They are usually
detached from the wider blood craft scene, being an ivory tower-like
organization.

They were formed in the mid-2000s, when
[thin-blood](./thinblood.md)
doctors, scientists, and occultist discussed their condition on an old
USENET newgroup. When Dr. Douglas Netchurch wrote the paper
*Thin-Blooded Syndrome*, the goal of the group shifted. The support
group soon turned into analyzing the implications of their condition.
They are not more of an academic association with studies on
transcending their condition, annual digital journal, *Curriculum
Vitae*.

The main philosophy of the group is that thin-bloods are the next step
in human evolution, the body is in an alt-state and thin-bloods have the
perfect balance. They see themselves as possessing immortality without
as many weaknesses of True Kindred, they are Neo-Humans. While the
details are still debated, it is the framing the group works off of.
They see the use of alchemy and well they can mingle with their prey as
proof of their evolution.  Their formulae focus on decreasing vampiric
weakness and perfecting Thin-Blood Alchemy.[2]

### The Calderone

Originating in the Valle d’Aosta region of Italy, the Claderone is a
[Ministry](./ministry.md)
subsect with a focus on Blood Sorcery. Their name means “the Cauldron.”
The [Tremere](./tremere.md) claim
the small group got their thaumaturgy from diablerie, but the group
smugly deny such claims. They show an interest in thin-blood alchemy and
experimentation.

They usually appear in a domain as helpful associates or even fun party
goers. Then they start setting conditions, eliminating weaker rivals,
and indoctrinating those caught in their web. Finally they push for an
upheaval, not for power, but to spiritually break others and gain
converts.[3]

### DOVECOTE

Created in reaction to various domain edicts calling for the branding of
thin-bloods, this group formed in a defense composed of alchemists and
hackers to push thin-bloods to be ready to defend themselves. They are
in North America and have some community members in Asia and Latin
America. They are secretive, new members must prove to be both a good
alchemist and trustworthy to keep a secret. It can take years to earn an
invitation, as they fiercely protect their members and records.

They focus on experimentation that can help alchemists fight or flee
enemies. They share new formulae and experiments on their chat servers
which are wiped daily. They have developed codewords to try to avoid
[SI](./second_inquisition.md)
detection or prying eyes. Many have a crossover in the designer drug
scene.[4]

#### CRONUS

An off-shoot of DOVECOTE. They are frustrated at DOVECOTE’s approach,
work for a more aggressive experimentation and defense. They are based
in Lagos, and meet in person. They focus more on why alchemy works.
Combing over historical alchemist and old recipes to understand the
process. When it comes to the
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md) or
any other opponent they aim to win their conflicts, not flee.[5]

### Lui Domien

A circle of koldunic sorcerers, attempting to awaken a new toxic element
in the earth.

In the 1740s, a
[Tzimisce](./tzimisce.md)
Koldunic sorcerer, Domien, settled in the swamps between Virginia and
North Carolina. He stayed apolitical for two centuries, but kept siring
childer. These childer soon traveled to the Great Lake cities of
Cleveland,
[Gary](./gary_in.md), Erie,
and
[Chicago](./chicago_ill.md)
in the 1930s feasting and mingling with Romanian communities.

They worked and analyzed the toxic waste from the industry of the area
and hypothesized that pollution could be the afterbirth of the American
Kupala. They called themselves Lui Domien, roughly meaning “Those of
Domien.” The kolduns seek to master this new element of poison they can
harness the power of. They look to thin-blood alchemists as a possible
avenue.

They either jealously guard their toxic lands or eagerly invite young
Tzimisce to study and spread their style of kolduny. Redworkers know
that the Lui Domien may have valuable ingredients in their hoards.
Thin-bloods are usually hesitant to answer such invitations.[6][7]

### The Plague Oracles

A collection of
[Malkavian](./malkavian.md)
redworkers who use blood sorcery and disease to gain information. It was
started in Spanish Chantry with the fall of the Pyramid, when they
turned to the Malkavians for a new form of Blood Sorcery. They spread
contagion and host it so they may study and attune to it.

Blood Sorcery used by Malkavians who see disease as a radio frequency
they can tap into. They see all those who have the same illness have a
mystical connection. The rites of these Plague Oracles tap into disease
to learn new insights or consensus. Examples like tapping into opinions
or knowledge of everyone with a flu in a certain city.

Most stay unopposed as outsiders are unsure of what they are doing.
During rituals many wear the infamous plague doctor masks. They have
developed such rituals as
[Viral Haruspex](./blood_sorcery_rituals.md) and Egregore
Consultation.[8][9]

### Sunburners

A faction of the
[Sabbat](./sabbat.md) composed of
thin-bloods who relish the burns from the sun on their flesh. They walk
the Path of Sun and may also be called Heliophiles. They follow a new
religious movement and see those who died from the short lifespan of
Duskborns in the Sabbat as martyrs. They see True Kindred with pity and
mortals as nothing but prey. They see alchemy as a form of worship and
work to harness the power of the sun. They appear on many redwork scenes
and usually are thought of as another blood cult. The danger is when
they decide to recruit thin-bloods who have little say in denying them
or the masquerade breaches they do in broad daylight.[10]

### Xtend Ltd.

Also known as XTD, is telecommunications company led by Indian tech
mogul and billionaire, Saviti Chopra. Her agents for her special project
are called Chopra-wafadar, they seek to steal from kindred, copy their
grimoire, or even capture them. She claims this special project is to
empower mortals and bring a brighter future. Xtend Ltd. isn’t as
expansive as other major tech companies; the headquarters resides in
Mumbai, India and three regional headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Dubai,
and Milpitas, California. Outside of South Asia, Tech Valley, and East
Africa, the company is still making strides to penetrate the telecom
market.

In reality, Mrs. Chopra’s crusade is an effort to save her ailing
husband, Satyavan Chopra. Satyavan was the founder and half the mind
behind Xtend. One day he got sick in ways medical science couldn’t
explain and went comatose forcing Saviti to take control. She discovered
a [Nagaraja](./hecata.md), Diya
Yadav, working in her Mumbai office and captured her. Here Chopra
learned of vampirism and saw the similarity in her husband’s condition.
Diya told of the chantry in Goa which led to raid by Xtend agents and
gave Mrs. Chopra information on blood sorcery.

With this knowledge Mrs. Chopra works to cure her husband by scouring
the blood craft scene for occult knowledge. She has occult researchers,
medical researchers, and private security teams at her call. She doesn't
care about the cost, be it human lives, money, or kindred. She has Xtend
seek and acquire human hedge magic, potions, healings, and anything that
can help her husband’s condition.

The copy operates by analyzing keywords on the Xtend Cloud servers, sent
over XTD mobile network, and using Diya to get her access to the
redworking scene. She has to be careful as she struggles to balance
keeping the profit-minded board of directors happy with her personal
quest for magic. She also realized raids like Goa chantry are not
sustainable and aims to not attract government attention, so Xtend
agents work subtly and strike when it is more advantageous.[11]

## Gehenna War

There are two main types of groups in Gehenna War: Those actively
fighting in the war and Those who exploit it to their own ends.
Previously established cults such as
<a href="Servitors_of_Irad" class="wikilink"
title="The Servitors of Irad">The Servitors of Irad</a>,
<a href="Shepherds_of_Ur-Shulgi" class="wikilink"
title="The Shepherds of Ur-Shulgi">The Shepherds of Ur-Shulgi</a> and
<a href="Los_Hijos_de_Si" class="wikilink" title="Los Hijos de Si">Los
Hijos de Si</a> are also listed in this book.

### The Cartographers

A decentralised network of
[Nosferatu](./nosferatu.md) who
seek profit by gathering and selling information, particularly
information related to the Gehenna War. This group tries to stay neutral
but many Nosferatu of influence do try to sway the group to fulfil their
own agendas. It is said that some of the older members are enamoured
with a Toreador Methuselah by the name of Ceri.[12]

### Cohort of Wepwawet

Believing themselves to be descendants of an apocryphal Methuselah,
Wepwawet. Hardliners from within the Church of Set originally tasked
with protecting the cult’s Egyptian holdings. The Cohort's main goal is
to ensure that all members of
[The Ministry](./ministry.md) belong to the
[Church of Set](./church_set.md), usually by forceful methods. They also wish to prove Wepwawet's
existence and awaken him to turn the tides of the Gehenna War in Set's
favour.[13]

### The Dead Lions

Found by former Archon Tabitha Delmare of Clan Toreador, the faction is
based in
[Singapore](./singapore.md).
The goal of the sect is to have a haven for kindred disenchanted with
the sects and be free to fight against the methuselah's machinations.
Ironically the methuselah Tiamat is rumored to have taken an
interest.[14]

### Garrote Vil

A Camarilla extremist group who actively suppress the beliefs of the
Antediluvians. They are a small, spread out group without a true leader
or headquarters. Their fears of the ancient steam from young kindred
being tempted to their Blood, more Kindred drawn to the Sabbat, and even
belief that if they suppress the information status quo will be
achieved. Their targets with dangerous knowledge are either recruited or
meet Final Death.[15]

### Moon's Army

A [Sabbat](./sabbat.md) pack that
seeks to hunt down and terminate
[Tremere](./tremere.md) and
[Salubri](./salubri.md) who are
pawns of their methuselahs. They operate mostly in Central and South
America led by Jeong-Bae Moon. Rigoberto Vindel is the lieutenant who
see visions of these enemy havens, though unbeknownst to the group
Vindel’s visions are a Goratrix’s doing. The group is purging the
Tremere methuselah's enemies.[16]

### The Boule

An <a href="autarkis" class="wikilink" title="autarkis">autarkis</a>
faction of bankers and knowledge hoarders that weathered the Sabbat
occupation of Michigan. Founded in Detroit, but has expanded across
Michigan in the United States since the Sabbat retreated from their
holdings. The faction handles kindred accounts across the country and
sometimes International ones. They have proved to be a safe financial
institution to hide and launder money from the SI. They also have hoards
of <a href="Noddist" class="wikilink" title="Noddist">Noddist</a> and
possibly Tremere artifacts. They do business with
[Anarchs](./anarch.md) and
Camarilla mostly. Sometimes Ashirra, and officially do not do business
with the Sabbat. They are defensive, but have hit squads, bribery, and
financial warfare in their toolbox.[17]

### The Circulatory System Board of Trust

  
*Main article: [Circulatory System](./circulatory_system.md)*

### Mora's Death Seers

There are many
[Hecata](./hecata.md) who have
rejected the Family Reunion and hold their cousins still responsible for
past crimes. One such group is a faction of Harbingers of Ashur led by
Mora. The group seeks to travel the world and end the Giovanni bloodline
and destroy Hecata of note. Mora claims to have the backing of
methuselah Unre. The Clan of Death does their best to suppress actions
of knowledge of his faction.[18]

### Oradea League

Originally based on the Carpathian Oradea League, an alliance between
domains of
[Tzimisce](./tzimisce.md)
elders, who rivaled the Camarilla. Now typically composed of Nosferatu,
[Gangrel](./gangrel.md), and
Tzimisce along with their servants and allies. It is an old form of
kindred rule before the Camarilla's growth; medieval ruling tactics of
absolute rule and overuse of supernatural powers to control the
populace. Similar league organizations exist all over the world in
modern nights. The Oradea League suffers from uncompromising ancient
autocrats, grudge holding, and shrinking influence to the major sects.
The beckoning has weakened them further and some Ancilla childer are
looking to join different sects.[19]

### Oswobodziciele

Also known as “the Liberators” or “the O,” they are a radical Anarch
group who seek to free others from kindred servitude. While some are
kindred sympathizers, many are independent or former ghouls freed from
domitors.[20] Many of the former masters are Anarchs, with one of the
original founders being
<a href="Agata_Starek" class="wikilink" title="Agata Starek’s">Agata
Starek’s</a> severely abused ghoul who escaped her in Krakow,
Poland.[21] Leader is supposedly called Cyrus, it is suspected to be a
shared alias among different individuals.

They are largely decentralized which make them tougher for Kindred to
combat as cells operate differently and have different levels of
information. Their general method is to find a blood bond ghoul, mark
their regent’s property with a red “O,” then work to free the ghoul and
destroy the domitor. Their methods include daylight raids, explosives,
and mortal manipulation; they hit hard and fast knowing a Kindred has
the edge on a longer conflict.

Membership has surged in modern nights and is strongest in North
America, Eastern Europe, and West Asia. The
[Second Inquisition](./second_inquisition.md) sees the group as a
useful tool and agent may discreetly fund a cell. Other SI Agents may
send tip to the group so they can act or even take the blame for SI
attacks. [22][23]

### Throne's Keepers

The group is based in Pristina, Kosovo. They are named after the famous
terracotta figurine of a mysterious goddess. Both discovery of the
figurine and discovery of the methuselah happened in the Yugoslavia
years which had many kindred fall under the figurine’s sway of this
“Goddess” and god her supernatural hardiness. The
[Malkavian](./malkavian.md)
Besim Sopi, acts as speaker to the Goddess and leader of the faction.
The group was a stabilizing force over the years of human wars, becoming
more than a mere cult and an actual faction in the region over the
decades. When kindred of other sects returned to find their haven’s
preserved by the Throne’s Keepers. This was good will for the faction
and followed by new orders from their faction: defend the domain no
matter what. They have taken to staunch defense and even launch
preemptive strikes on supposed threats. They have friendly relations
with the
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md) and
Ashirra, but their preemptive strikes may soon sour that.

The city holds a blood sport, The Sanguine Race, where kindred teams
need to transport a mortal across the city. The Goddess gives visions of
the targets to the other team, usually dear to the participants. The
teams try to outpace the opposing teams or kill the opposing team’s
mortal. Victors earn status and acclaim while losers may find themselves
exiled.[24]
