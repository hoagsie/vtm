## Antagonist basics

Kindred, while being apex predators, do not coast through their domains
without danger. Antagonists in Vampire: The Masquerade are threats that
stories can be shaped around or included to increase the dramatic
tension or danger of character choices.

There are many different types of threats to Kindred. Other Kindred may
certainly oppose them, looking to stop or otherwise interfere with their
plans due to personal reasons or sect-related. Werewolves, ghosts, and
other supernatural beings exist as well, many of whom may not take
kindly to the presence of a bloodsucker. Storytellers may base their
chronicle's monsters on local urban legends and folklore or adapt those
presented in the book to their chosen regions. Then there are vampire
hunters, mortals who are aware of them and seek to destroy them, in
addition to the Second Inquisition with similar plans. Finally, there
are the mundane mortals and animals, who may only be defending
themselves or others from someone they see as a threat, even if they are
unaware of their true identity.

## General Difficulties

The simplest foe will usually only need a description and a difficulty
level - for example "Ghost 3". This makes the tests against this
creature to be of Difficulty 3 in order to defeat the monster. Most
antagonists will only need pools for key action categories and specific
actions, as opposed to an entire sheet with detailed Attribute or Skill
values. Should a Storyteller need to roll the pool for an antagonist,
they roll twice the amount of the Difficulty. Another option is to roll
a single die everytime the antagonist's Difficulty comes into play,
should they roll a 0, treat it as a Critical and add +2 Difficulty for
that test. [1]

Some stat blocks might include a general difficulty, rather than the
Storyteller needing to determine one. They come in the form of two
numbers that are divided by a "/", the first number denotes the
Difficulty in things they excel at whereas the second is everything
else. [2]

## Antagonist expenditures

For the Storyteller who wishes to spend less time tracking the
antagonist's Hunger and Willpower especially when there are multiple of
them. Below are three alternate methods that can be used.

1\. Dispense all of it together, raising the appropriate antagonist's
dice pools to compensate.

2\. Keep a tally of expenditures per scene and set a number that
antagonists may use to share.

3\. Keep a general pool of bonus dice to throw when needed. [3]

## Statblocks

Included in many books are statblocks helpful for Storytellers when
introducing different antagonists.

## Mortals

Mortals serve many purposes to the undead. They allow Kindred to
maintain contact with life and in turn their
[Humanity](./humanity.md), but
they also serve as a source of blood for their nourishment. In the same
way that they can be tools that aid Kindred, they also can be
surprisingly dangerous threats. Not every mortal will tolerate being
pushed around, some will fight back. Mortals are even sometimes aware of
the supernatural, looking to destroy the creatures of the night. [4]

## Second Inquisition

## Animals

Many animals will shy away or otherwise retreat from Kindred, though
there are those who may be drawn towards them instead. [5]

## Other Kindred

While both the Camarilla and Anarchs may recount stories of both sects
being united within themselves, but elders often pit the younger Kindred
against each other. There are even times that fledglings may unite to
conspire against the tyrannical leaders above them. [6]
