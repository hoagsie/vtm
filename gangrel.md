\_\_TOC\_\_ **Gangrel** are one of the fourteen vampire clans of
Vampire: The Masquerade. Often closer to beasts than other vampires, and
so the Gangrel style themselves apex predators. These Ferals prowl the
wilds as easily as the urban jungle, and no clan of vampires can match
their ability to endure, survive, and thrive in any environment. Often
fiercely territorial, their shapeshifting abilities even give the undead
pause.[1]

Gangrels are generally
<a href="Embrace" class="wikilink" title="embraced">embraced</a> from
prospects who show the ability to survive and fighters. Due to this
their customs encourage fights for dominance but not to
[final death](./final_death.md) as they push for a culture of healthy rivalry rather than
taking competition personally. They are usually the outcasts of Kindred
society, learning to live in undesirable areas and yet thrive without
bending the knee to a Prince or Baron. Gangrels tend to care less about
appearances and status than they do about action and accomplishments.[2]

## Disciplines

Below are the powers innate to the Gangrel as well as the uses they find
in it.

- **Animalism** gives the Gangrel the ability to make an animal their
  companion.
- **Fortitude** allows them to live their desires by traversing harsh
  landscapes or absorbing a rain of bullets.
- **Protean** is something they are known to have mastery over. Giving
  them the ability to shape their body into that of something
  animalistic.

## Bane

<section begin="bane" />

**Bestial Features** - In
[Frenzy](./frenzy.md), Gangrel
gains animalistic features equal to their Bane Severity. These features
last for one more night afterward, each feature reducing one Attribute
by 1 point. The Gangrel may choose to Ride the Wave in order to only
have one feature manifest and only lose one Attribute point.

## Compulsion

<section begin="compulsion" />

**Feral Impulses** - Unleash the animal hidden in their Blood. This
urges the Gangrel to regress into an animalistic state where speech
becomes difficult, clothes become too constrictive and arguments and
best settled with claws and teeth. For one scene the Gangrel suffers a
-3 dice penalty to all rolls involving Manipulation and Intelligence as
they are only able to speak one word sentences during this Compulsion.

## Example archetypes

- **Uncaged Jailbird** - Imprisoned for most of their lives, they hold a
  jaded perspective and an issue with authority. Still, they survive
  from the desperate taste of freedom they've been given finally.
- **Storyteller** - One way to make friends is by telling tales of
  fantastical stories, be it of their own experiences or made entirely
  of fiction. Whether within a tent city or a convention, they are great
  socialists and make friends easily as they recall their tales.
- **Business First** - Maybe they were stolen from a
  [Ventrue](./ventrue.md), or
  maybe clans aren't defined by a stereotype. Their animalistic
  tendencies make them great at haggling deals and scaring smaller
  companies into selling.
- **Veterinarian** - Their bond with animals has pushed them into the
  associated medical field, though they still aren't fond of mortals,
  they are happy to help animals in need.

## Culture

### Embraces

The clan of Gangrel often embrace those who are outsiders, independent
hunters, and any one with wanderlust literal or figurative. Gangrel
sires love to usually embrace with the urge to fight or survive
regardless of their environment. Those who go out bravely into the world
and don’t care about the odds against them: businessmen, explorers,
rogues, gamblers, etc. When it comes to the ideal childe, their beauty
and rank typically mean little, most Gangrel sires want to see what
their potential childe has achieved.[9]

### Mortal society

The Gangrel is a perfect manifestation of their culture and beast, stuck
between literal beast and Kindred, never trapped in one place or form.
Some even take on the aggressive and territorial aspects of animals. How
this translates to Gangrel and humans relations is with some Ferals
taking humans and considering them their “pack.” The Gangrel will
sometimes establish their dominance and cow their pack into line while
taking a form of ownership. Many do not feed on their own and look down
on those who “weaken their pack,” preferring to use them for services or
even companions.[10]

### Kindred society

The Gangrel are marked with a culture of individualism and wander. Some
often travel through domains and cities, crossing borders and city lines
as they collect different stories, histories, or adventures. Though they
are known to meet around campfires with their clanmates to regal in
their adventures they are also prone to the need to establish pecking
order, the clan has a culture of friendly rivalry where strength is
respected.[11]

### Factional differences

They have less faction differences than other clans. Stereotyped as the
loyal dog of the clans, the Gangrel filled the roles of bodyguards,
enforcers, and hunters. Many of the clan left the Camarilla when they
felt taken advantage of, but not all Gangrel went Anarch. Whether a
Camarilla or Anarch, when a Gangrel arrives to a domain many are
reluctant to ask them to leave as fighting is usually the only way to
get the Gangrel to leave. This has opened a chance for Ferals to work as
mercenaries on their travels from domain to domain.[12]
