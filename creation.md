## Attributes

Attributes represent the characters innate abilities, with 1 being
relatively bad, 2 being average and up to 5 which represents peak
ability. The Attributes are divided into three separate categories;
Physical, Social and Mental. [4]

When building the sheet; the player will place one attribute at 1 dot,
four attributes at 2 dots, three attributes at 3 dots, and one final
attribute at 4 dots with this being the vampire's best trait.

### <a href="Physical" class="wikilink" title="Physical">Physical</a>

The Physical Attributes measure the general Strength, Dexterity, and
Stamina of a character. These Attributes represent the mortal prowess of
a vampire's body. Though through the use of certain Disciplines,
vampires often exceed the abilities of an otherwise frail-looking
physique.

**<a href="Strength" class="wikilink" title="Strength">Strength</a>:**
How strong the character is, how much they can lift, and how much force
they can exert.

**<a href="Dexterity" class="wikilink" title="Dexterity">Dexterity</a>:**
How agile a character is, how graceful they can be, or how nimble those
fingers are.

**<a href="Stamina" class="wikilink" title="Stamina">Stamina</a>:** The
character's physical resistance, how long they can persevere through
hazards and other strenuous activities, or how much damage they can
absorb.

### <a href="Social" class="wikilink" title="Social">Social</a>

The Social Attributes reflect how easily the character can communicate
with vampires and mortals alike to achieve their goals. Through
deception or charisma, some battles are easier won through words than
combat. These attributes reflect that by determining how their
interactions are shaped through their ability to charm, persuade and
motivate others to help them; though it is not always as wholesome as it
may seem.

**<a href="Charisma" class="wikilink" title="Charisma">Charisma</a>:**
Determines the character's natural appeal, charm and grace. With this
attribute they'll be able to draw people into them although do not
mistake this for good looks, that is a merit all on it's own. [5]

**<a href="Manipulation" class="wikilink"
title="Manipulation">Manipulation</a>:** Showcases how skilled the
character is at being an effective liar, their ability to twist others
to a winning point of view, and how deceptive they are.

**<a href="Composure" class="wikilink" title="Composure">Composure</a>:**
Reflects how well the character can maintain and command their own
emotions. As well as how easily they can calm nerves and the anxieties
of others. It also represents their ability to stay calm-headed in
heated situations such as verbal fights and even firefights.

### <a href="Mental" class="wikilink" title="Mental">Mental</a>

The Mental Attributes represent the character's natural intuition, the
ability to learn quickly and react quickly with thoughts rather than
their bodies. It also represents their determination and dedication to
accomplishing something.

**<a href="Intelligence" class="wikilink"
title="Intelligence">Intelligence</a>:** Represents the character's
ability to gather knowledge through research or reason as well as apply
logic to an ongoing problem. They have an easier time recalling
information they have gathered before and can analyze information from
the world around them or the books they've read.

**<a href="Wits" class="wikilink" title="Wits">Wits</a>:** Reflects the
character's ability to think quickly on their feet and make decisions
based on the information around them or from prior knowledge. Wits allow
the character to pick up sounds and smells around them, perhaps
preventing a possible ambush from happening without warning. It is also
representative of a character's street smarts and know what to say in
the heat of the moment. Rather than mulling on it the next night and
realizing they had the perfect comeback to that snobby harpy the entire
time.

**<a href="Resolve" class="wikilink" title="Resolve">Resolve</a>:**
Measures the raw determination of a character and how strong their focus
truly is. This Attribute powers the all-night stakeouts. Allowing the
character to create a mental block from any distractions, showcasing
their mental fortitude and concentration.

From these players can derive a few more traits.

- **<a href="Health" class="wikilink" title="Health">Health</a>:**
  Stamina+3
- **<a href="Willpower" class="wikilink" title="Willpower">Willpower</a>:**
  Composure + Resolve [6]
- **<a href="Humanity" class="wikilink" title="Humanity">Humanity</a>:**
  The base Humanity for a neonate and lower is 7, not including any
  changes from their Predator types. It is possible for a fresh embrace
  to begin at Humanity 8. [7]

## Skills

Similar to Attributes, Skills are defined as follows. No dots means they
have no knowledge or formal training, one being that they have basic
knowledge, two is general knowledge, three is a professional Skill
level, four means they've specialized in this, and five is mastery of
the Skill. [8]

The distribution of Skills is a choice between three different options;

- **Jack of All Trades:** One Skill at 3 dots, eight Skills at 2 dots,
  and ten Skills at 1 dot.
- **Balanced:** Three Skills at 3 dots, five Skills at 2 dots, and seven
  Skills at 1 dot.
- **Specialist:** One Skill at 4 dots, three Skills at 3 dots, three
  Skills at 2 dots, and three Skills at 1 dot.

Following this is Skill specialty, which is specific expertise in a
given Skill. If the players have allotted dots into the Skills
Academics, Craft, Performance, and/or Science they will need to choose a
free specialty for those with dots. Then they will have one more
additional free specialty to place in any Skill. Don't forget to add in
the spec from the Predator type and remember that characters can only
have a specialty in a Skill for as many dots as they have except in
specific cases such as the Craft Skill. If the character gains a
specialty from the Predator type but has no dots in the Skill, the
specialty can instead be converted to the first dot of one Skill. [9]

## Disciplines

  
*Main Article: <a href="Disciplines" class="wikilink"
title="Disciplines">Disciplines</a>*

Disciplines are selected from the character's three clan Disciplines.
Pick two of them; one of the two chosen Disciplines starts at level 2,
the other at level 1. Keep in mind that many Disciplines offer more than
one power option, so the player must decide which of the available
powers they wish the character to have. They can pick a power from the
level of the Discipline the character is currently at or below for a
total of five powers if the Discipline is maxed out.

The Caitiff do not have in-clan Disciplines and instead can pick from
all Disciplines. Thin-bloods, unless they have
<a href="Merits_and_Flaws#Discipline_Affinity" class="wikilink"
title="Discipline Affinity">Discipline Affinity</a>, do not have
permanent access to Disciplines other than
<a href="Thin-blood_Alchemy" class="wikilink"
title="Thin-blood Alchemy">Thin-blood Alchemy</a>, relying instead on
temporarily gaining Disciplines from feeding from mortals with different
<a href="Resonance" class="wikilink" title="Resonances">Resonances</a>.

## Chronicle Tenets

Chronicle Tenets are the guidelines by which the chronicle will run and
should be set up by the players with the Storyteller. These tenets can
encapsulate anything from genre or period emulation, dramatic irony, or
personal taste. However, if something might have genuine risk or trauma
to another player in the group it should be a topic avoided by the
players and Storyteller. *See
<a href="Considerate_play" class="wikilink"
title="Considerate play">Considerate play</a>.*

The Chronicle Tenets apply to all player characters in the chronicle
regardless if the character holds this belief personally and when broken
will give Stains leading to possible degeneration of Humanity. [10]

## Touchstones and Convictions

Convictions are the guidelines by which a vampire wishes to live their
unlife. They may be personal mortal codes, societal expectations,
religious codes, or other things the character does or considers without
weighing the ethical or philosophical weight. [11] Convictions are not
required to be morally good, rather they are simply the way the vampire
traverses the night. A high humanity vampire might still have
convictions allowing murder, whereas a low humanity vampire might not.

Touchstones are a vampire's connection to the mortal world, representing
a mindset in which they value themselves. A Touchstone must be a single
living human being. The touchstone might be a surviving partner or
family member, related to someone who the vampire killed in their early
unlife or even just something they run into regularly. Some Kindred, due
to their disconnect from the mortal world may even pick a Touchstone who
doesn't know they exist, instead choosing to stalk and watch over the
human to retain their connections to humanity. [12]

Characters will begin with a minimum of 1 Conviction to a maximum of 3
with each Conviction being tied directly to a Touchstone.

## Advantages and Flaws

### Merits and Flaws

  
*Main Article: <a href="Merits_and_Flaws" class="wikilink"
title="Merits and Flaws">Merits and Flaws</a>*

Alongside their Attributes, Skills, and Disciplines, Kindred also have
Advantages from the time before they started the Chronicle. Advantages
are broken down into different types which are Merits, Backgrounds, and
Loresheets. The opposite end of Advantages are Flaws, which are ongoing
problems for the characters.

- Vampires will begin with 7 dots worth of Advantages with 2 Flaws plus
  any additional due to their age if using Sea of Time, however, this
  number excludes any of the Merits and Flaws from the Predator type.
- Thin-bloods must take an additional number, from 1 to 3, of thin-blood
  Merits with a matching number of thin-blood Flaws.

### Loresheets

  
*Main Article:
<a href="Loresheets" class="wikilink" title="Loresheets">Loresheets</a>*

Loresheets can be purchased using the 7 dots of Advantages listed above
