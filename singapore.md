## Overview

<section begin=summary/>

Also referred to as the Lion City, the island country of Singapore is a
vibrant city that combines modern sensibilities with time-honored
traditions. Singapore does not have traditional
<a href="Kindred" class="wikilink" title="Kindred">Kindred</a> power
structures, such as the
<a href="Camarilla" class="wikilink" title="Camarilla">Camarilla</a> and
their Prince or
<a href="Anarch" class="wikilink" title="Anarch">Anarch</a> gangs.
Instead, it is a stronghold for the

- Marguerite, a free spirit who joins the Dead Lions, not believing the
  Camarilla or Anarchs are equipped to handle the threat. [4]

## Notable Groups

- The Dead Lions - A gathering army to oppose the methuselahs. Their
  goal is to create a haven for free-thinking Kindred to wage war
  against the methuselahs and their pawns. The Dead Lions are noted to
  be unusually adept at finding

## Prominent locations

### Good Class Bungalows

The Good Class Bungalow, also referred to as GCB, is prime real estate.
These homes are for the 'Singaporean buyer only' and are considered
status symbols. They are often in secluded neighborhoods that give a
high level of privacy. High walls, large gardens, and private roads are
often part of this privacy. Owners within this group also have plenty of
flexibility when designing these homes, which was why the Dead Lions
acquired one. The Dead Lions base of operations is located in District
20, which is close to Windsor park.[6]

### The Pacific Gale

At an initial inspection, the Pacific Gale, appears to be an
unremarkable steel-hulled container ship with nothing going on. This
ship is docked in the Port of Singapore and owned by a
<a href="Church_of_Set" class="wikilink" title="Church of Set">Church of
Set</a> front. Inside of the ship is a sleeping methuselah, which is
currently enroute from Hong Kong to Jebel Ali. Deep in the bowels of the
ship is the highly sophisticated, well-hidden and strong security
chamber that houses the sleeping methuselah. [7]

### Other Locations

- Windsor Park[8]
- Changi Airport[9]
- Marina Bay Sands[10][11]
- District 20[12]
- Buddha Tooth Relic Temple[13]
- Singapore Botanic Gardens[14]
- Pulau Hantu[15]

## Important events

Archon Tabitha Delmare abandoned the Camarilla domain when her alarm
about the
<a href="Gehenna" class="wikilink" title="Gehenna War">Gehenna War</a>
was not heeded. She now acts as the authority in Singapore, with a call
to arms against the methuselahs. Singapore is quickly becoming home to
many Kindred who are similarly disenchanted with the sects. With the
growing army within the city, the great Tiamat has taken notice of this
and moving to use it for her own purposes.

Because this city has a strategic location and a population of over five
million, it offers Delmare an ideal base of operations. A self-contained
city-state, that has access limited to two bridges from Malaysia. It
also includes one of the most active shipping ports in the world, with
half of the world's supply of crude oil passing through. This makes it a
critical gateway between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This is
leveraged by Delmare, who requires Kindred to pay a large fee for
passage through. [16]
