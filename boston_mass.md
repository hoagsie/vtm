## Overview

<section begin="summary" />

Boston is an American city located in the New England region of the USA.
It is the seat of power in which the ruling Prince usually reigns over
the region. It is also a domain that has not known peace; once a
battleground for the
[London](./london_uk.md)
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md),
Boston Camarilla, and
[Sabbat](./sabbat.md) with some
meddling from the
[Hecata](./hecata.md). The former
Prince was a
[Malkavian](./malkavian.md)
<a href="Quentin_King_III" class="wikilink"
title="Quentin King III">Quentin King III</a>, who ruled with his
repressive coteries, the Redcoats. Caught between factions, elders, and
his own Primogen council. The constant fighting suddenly ended in the
2000s when the Sabbat left, the elders
[Beckoned](./beckoning.md), the
Hecata withdrew, and then finally the Prince disappeared. Years later,
the relatively young ancilla, Prince
<a href="Hazel_Iversen" class="wikilink" title="Hazel Iversen">Hazel
Iversen</a> of clan
[Ventrue](./ventrue.md), now
rules—a stronger-willed Prince than the Primogen council expected. Time
will tell if she can bring all of New England under her rule or fall to
the hidden threats of the region.

### Other Notable Kindred

Quentin King III - Malkavian, Once a New York detective and Former
long-reigning Prince of Boston. He ushered in a Malkavian-dominated New
England. His connections spanned the region, though he was suspected to
be the Triad’s puppet. Now disappeared and his clan used as scapegoats
for the domain’s misfortunes. [18]

<a href="Emem_Louis" class="wikilink" title="Emem Louis">Emem Louis</a> -
Toreador, once a member of the court who entertained Elysium with her
performances. After a severe incident under Quentin King’s regime,

Diamond” for his work as Boston's Scourge for many decades. Under
Iversen, he still serves the court as a fixer. One of the older Kindred

unfinished business. [23][24]

Upton Rowlands - Ventrue, Prince of New Haven, owes a debt to both
Hartford Chantry and Prince Iversen. He used to have Hartford in his
domain, but it is now part of Hazel’s main domain diminishing his power.
[25]

Kurt Densch - Nosferatu, Former Prince of Rhode Island after his sire
Warwick of the Triad vanished. Expert spy, and leader of the web. He has

### Groups

#### Hartford Chantry

  
*Main article: <a href="Hartford_Chantry" class="wikilink"
title="Hartford Chantry">Hartford Chantry</a>*

One of the Major centers of Tremere activity in New England, centered in
<a href="Locations#Hartford,_USA" class="wikilink"
title="Hartford, Connecticut">Hartford, Connecticut</a>. An ally and
somewhat rival, but their specialty in memory magic and blood
preservation makes them valuable to Boston Cam. They usually strive to
be inconspicuous, but Iversen has reached out diplomatically. They have
a branch in Boston, the Jefferson Library, which was given to them by
Iversen in 1960 to bolster the member of the Gemini League. They
operated discretely at first to resist Quentin King's reign, then in
2014 they operated openly when Iversen took the throne. Hazel does not
have jurisdiction there as it is considered an extension of the Harford
domain. [30][31]

#### Salem Chantry

  
*Main article:
<a href="Salem_Chantry" class="wikilink" title="Salem Chantry">Salem
Chantry</a>*

Isolationists Tremere Chantry that were founded in the 17th century by
Madeline Coventry. As one of the oldest New England chantries, they once
held considerable power, but it waned in light of Sabbat attacks and
Quentin King's rise. Supposedly holding superior numbers, they were
convinced they were ahead of Boston and Hartford in knowledge. The
recent alliance of Hartford and Boston has caused tension with the Salem
Regent. They see the unification as a threat.[32]

#### The Triad

The old faction of British Camarilla that dominated the region, loyal to
<a href="Mithras" class="wikilink" title="Mithras">Mithras</a>. Their
fighting coteries called the Redcoats were used take over New England to
enforce Triad rule, suppress the Kindred of Liberty, and fight the
Sabbat. They were led by three elders, but the
[Beckoning](./beckoning.md)
seems to have called them away. Modern nights, they have seemingly
retreated or converted to the Boston Camarilla, though some say the old
guard bides their time waiting for a new invasion.[33][34]

Former leaders:

- Pendragon,
  [Brujah](./brujah.md). - Led the
  war effort against the Sabbat and any resistance in his way. He
  focused on Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont to combat the Crimson
  Tide.[35]
- Biltmore, Malkavian - The kindred who pulled Quentin King's strings
  from the shadows, secretly support King against the Sabbat, and
  conditioned the former Prince's Knights to be loyal. Had his redcoats
  as Boston's domain enforcers.[36] His childe is
  <a href="Richard_Dunham" class="wikilink" title="Richard Dunham">Richard
  Dunham</a>.
- Stanford Warwick, Nosferatu. - Founder of the Web. Former Prince of
  Providence, Rhode Island. His expansive spy network was largely a
  secret. His childe is Kurt Densch.[37][38]

#### The Web

A clandestine information gathering and trading Nosferatu coteries.
Thought to be an Anarch conspiracy was actually a tool by the Triad, led
by Warwick until his beckoning, then led by Kurt Densch until his
absence, then by the still active operatives.[39][40]

#### The Gemini League

A defunct coterie of Ventrue and Tremere who used their resources to
maintain their influence in Connecticut during the New England Wars.
Many former members compose or ally the modern Hartford Chantry. [41]

#### The Kindred of Liberty

Abbreviated KoL, called “Coals” or sometimes Bostonians, they were the
American Camarilla who had underground resistance to the British
Camarilla. As the domain shifted politically, they found themselves
winners of the region. Officially dissolved, they live on, reincarnated
as the Boston Camarilla and current ruling government.[42]

#### The Crimson Tide

The name for New England's
[Sabbat](./sabbat.md). They used
the tactic of mass Embrace in smaller communities and using them as
shock troops to urban centers. Other tactics include kidnapping ghouls,
indoctrinating then, then using them for day time raids. They were often
staved off Boston proper due to constant wars with Pendragon's forces.
They seemingly disappeared when the Gehenna War started. Last reports
had them causing carnage up through Portland, Maine, kidnapping vessels,
and sailing from the region in two stolen ships.[43][44][45]

#### One Moon

This cult believes Malkavians used to be one single being that
experiences the world through those of the bloodline. They live with
identities intermingling with each other. Their main site is at the
Starfall Ranch.[46]

## Prominent Locations

### The African Meeting House

The oldest black church in the United States. Now a museum is used as an
occasional meeting place for Anarchs. [47]

### Black Ratters

Lounge clubs with three locations around the Greater Boston area. House,
jazz, and downtempo music. It has become an unofficial meeting place for
Kindred of different sects and ages.[48]

### Combat Zone

Formerly known as a red light district for kine in the past. Even with
high-rises, it is still one for Kindred behind the scenes with blood
dolls and pit fights with ghouls. [49]

### Faneuil Hall

Site of historical significance to both Kindred and kine. Kindred use it
as a place to do business with witnesses present.[50]

### Fenway Park

Famous baseball stadium claimed by Primogen Delsin Coates, an avid
baseball fan. [51]

### The Grand

Prince Iversen uses this luxurious club. Celebrity DJs and venues as a
personal court. Only she is allowed to feed here.[52]

### Harvard University

A famous institution of learning and even possessing museums in its
system. No hunting is allowed on campus.[53][54]

### Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Also known as MIT, a famous institution for science, technology,
engineering, and math. It is also a prime location for Kindred to
recruit science-minded kine.[55]

### Quincy Market

Popular market complex by tourists and locals. A neutral meeting ground
for Kindred.[56]

### The Red Salons

Prince’s major initiative to cut down on hunting mishaps. The Red Salon
has various locations that operate as an invite-only supermarket for
trafficked vessels in a secure location. Even with induced resonances.
Underworld works the finances and Duhham the science behind it. The
Salons have some friction with the rival
[Circulatory System](./circulatory_system.md). The Anarchs
cautiously back this practice.[57][58][59]

### Elysia

- Museum of Fine Arts

<!-- -->

- Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum

Two museums both declared permanent Elysia. Though The Keeper prefers
private or Kindred-owned locations, these Elysia are used by the
Primogen for personal meetings.[60]

### The Princes Refuge

A high-rise on Nashua Street. Owned by Prince Iversen. The lower floors
have innocuous businesses owned by the Prince. The top floors operate as
luxury apartments, some of which the Primogen keep as havens and
offices. This tower also has meeting rooms, gathering spots, Red Salon
bar, an office for court positions, records, and computer security. The
uppermost floors are for the Prince’s personal use and her meeting room.
[61]

### New England Region

This region is made up of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, and Connecticut. This region's position and historical
significance made it highly sought after by kine and Kindred. The New
England region had always been a contentious domain, even in the 17th
century: <a href="Lupine" class="wikilink" title="Lupine">Lupine</a>
prowled in between cities, making travel treacherous and cities feel
more isolated, the harsh winters forced Kindred into cannibalism or
torpor, and the Sabbat sent many warpacks to conquer the region under
the name Crimson Tide. Vermont had seen an extremely low Kindred
population for these reasons at first.[62]

### Starfall Ranch

A famous ranch in the Northeastern United States. The cattle and horses
it raises has seen many accolades. The owner is Dr.Starr. A mysterious
Malkavian and cult leader of the One Moon. He opens his ranch to
downtrodden Malkavians as a halfway house of sorts. Rumor has it some
Malkavian elders are beckoned here.[63][64]

### Rhode Island

Providence had two former Nosferatu Princes Warwick, a Mithraist of the
British Camarilla, then Kurt Densch, an agent of the Web. Now the state
as a whole is ruled by a Primogen council called the Senate. One Senator
is known as Stephan Thunderhorse of Clan Ventrue. [65][66][67]

## Important Events

### Tremere Dominance

The Tremere first saw dominance and influence in the region in the 17th
and 18th century, weathering these forces. The first to come to the
region was Madeline Coventry,
[Tremere](./tremere.md) Elder
from the British Winchester Chantry in 1635. She first founded the Salem
Chantry and soon influenced Boston. She got her Tremere from those that
would have died in the Salem Witch Trials. The
[Clan Ventrue](./ventrue.md)
and
[Clan Brujah](./brujah.md)
arrived in droves to the region, starting their conflict for power and
influence. They were Kindred who sought to free themselves of elders
from the old world in the Americas. The Ventrue took control of
Massachusetts Bay Colony, at constant odds with the Brujah. It was soon
realized it was more than just those three main clans; the
[Sabbat](./sabbat.md) had already
arrived previously with the Spanish they were starting to encroach and
the [Gangrel](./gangrel.md)
skulked in the wilds near
<a href="Lupine" class="wikilink" title="Lupine">Lupine</a>
territory.[68][69]

The American Revolution reverberated to the Kindred world with domains
at war; the Loyalist, who still served European Camarilla Princes,
fought the young Kindred seeking a new start in the USA. This at times
even had the revolutionaries ally with the Sabbat to get the advantage.
A loyalist Ventrue Prince ruled the throne of Boston for much of the
war. Coventry becomes a notorious foe to Loyalist Ventrue, she allies
with Brujah and Sabbat members.  In 1783, at the war’s end, the Brujah,
Gangrel, and Malkavian took control of Boston from the former prince.
The Boston clans couldn’t decide on a balance of power, allowing the
Tremere to return to Boston in the same year and create the Boston
Chantry and Madeline Coventry to rule Boston. The Sabbat began their
attack on Camarilla holdings in Boston from their strongholds in Maine.

The Warlocks now had  three major chantries: Hartford Chantry, Boston
Chantry, and Salem Chantry. One of these major chantries was suspected
of using the Sabbat in an attempt to subdue another chantry’s power,
only causing the whole clan to have their grip erode on the region. This
suspected betrayal still puts the chantries at odds even in the modern
day. Coventry is unable to stave off all the challenges to her rule and
retreats to Salem possibly in Torpor, her status unknown even to this
day. This allowed the Clan Malkavian to grab power in 1825; Quentin King
III seized power with his coterie of Malkavian “Knights”. King was a
police inspector in his mortal days and surprisingly well-connected.
While these Knights were composed of his childer and Malkavian fanatics
pledging support, with a shared delusion and blood bond together. The
Sabbat renewed their assault on Camarilla territory and King’s holdings.
The Salem Colony was overrun for a time in 1831 by the Sabbat. Even to
this day, Salem Chantry holds an isolationist policy from these
events.[70][71]

### The New England Wars

Things improved a bit in the mid-19th century, as the Sabbat faced a
major challenge, the British Camarilla from the Prince of
[London](./london_uk.md),
<a href="Mithras" class="wikilink" title="Mithras">Mithras</a>. However
instead of aiding the New England Camarilla, the British Camarilla
sought to subjugate all. This resulted in a three-way war: the Sabbat
and the two sides of the Camarilla. The British Camarilla coterie of
elders called the Triad, was assigned by Mithras. The three
[Mithraist](./mithraic_mysteries.md) Lords of the Triad coterie were
Pendragon of Clan Brujah, Warwick of Clan Nosferatu, and Biltmore of
Clan Malkavian.

Open fighting had become rare except for the Sabbat’s tactics and
fighting <a href="Lupine" class="wikilink" title="Lupines">Lupines</a>
in the forest. More subtle means came into vogue. The Crimson Tide, New
England’s Sabbat, clashed with Pendragon in Maine, New Hampshire, and
Vermont. In Massachusetts, Prince Quentin King III became a puppet of
the Triad shortly into his reign in a desperate attempt to stave off the
Crimson Tide. Effectively adding Massachusetts to the British
Camarilla’s sphere of influence. Biltmore used his Redcoats to establish
the British Hegemony in Boston and secretly back the King. Pendragon
focused his forces on the Sabbat. The Boston Camarilla, badgered by the
Sabbat murders and abduction as well as the British Camarilla’s rising
power, were focused underground and formed two main groups: The Kindred
of Liberty in Massachusetts and the Gemini League in Connecticut.

The Kindred of Liberty, also known as the KoL’s, saw Massachusetts as
stable compared to the rest of New England, but found foreign rule
untenable. The Gemini League was a pact of Ventrue and Tremere coteries
that fought the Triad to maintain control of Connecticut, but found
themselves isolated and manipulated. An even more secretive coterie is
said to have existed to manipulate them all, The Web. This tangled
political landscape persisted for years, sometimes called the New
England Wars.

### Reign of Prince Quentin King

The Prince Quentin King was largely suspected to have become a puppet of
the British Camarilla. His domain had odd quirks; his enforcers were a
group of Malkvisn, his questing knights, who saw themselves as Knights
of the Round Table and Quentin as King Arthur. Even though such
delusions were off-putting, they proved effective and were even gifted
land. This allowed for a nearly century and a half of relative peace.
Even then, Quentin found himself in a precarious position too weak to
interfere with the Triads’s influence over him or even meddle with their
activities. His energy was spent keeping Boston in line until the 20th
century when he decided to make a move. He invited the Giovanni (the
pre-Hecata Clan of Death) to join Boston as a fully realized Camarilla
Clan, in a bid to get allies.

The Giovanni had been given voting rights, feeding rights, and a say in
the war against the Sabbat. King underestimated the Giovanni’s
coordination; while clans aren’t usually factions, the Giovanni were
skillfully coordinated. Andreas Giovanni colluded with fellow Giovanni
and Milliner members to exert power in Boston. They increased the number
of Giovanni and ceremonies in Boston to make Boston a necromantic
stronghold. With the Milliners handling finances and Giovanni handling
the agenda, King was shocked and upset at the sabotage.

In the infamous event at the turn of the millennia in Elysium, Prince
Quentin King tried to step down, prompting other parties to start
scheming, but his own Redcoats staked him and carried him away. He would
return a week later, having been reprimanded by Biltmore and reminded of
his place. He returned to power as a puppet Prince and watched the
Hecata grow in power, pushing the Kindred of Liberty further
underground. The New England Wars now had a front against the Giovanni
as they were a rival faction.

The war raged with each faction adopting different tactics. The Sabbat
group, Crimson Tide, saw mass embraces in rural and isolated communities
to gain quick shock troops and abduction of camarilla ghouls for
conversion to sleeper assassins. The Kindred of Liberty leaked the
Redcoat’s hideouts to the Sabbat and assassinated high-ranking Redcoat
agents. Even with this, the Redcoats of the British Camarilla were more
coordinated and recovered. They had the Web to get information on their
enemies and outmaneuver them. Meanwhile, all the conflict only
strengthened the Clan of Death as they got more wraiths and dead to work
with. They had the Milliners use legal and financial means to wage their
war: tax audits, repossession, court summons, etc.[72]

### The New England Gehenna

The New England
<a href="Gehenna" class="wikilink" title="Gehenna">Gehenna</a> was an
event that took place in the region with elder disappearances that left
long-lasting vacuums and upheavals in powers. First, the Sabbat left,
with the Crimson Tide supposedly going to Maine and stealing a ship so
they could engage in their crusade. This was one of the first American
regions to experience the phenomenon. The remaining factions called for
Breaker’s Truce, a joint investigation into the matter. They found no
wrongdoing on each other, but the Sabbat left from Maine mysterious.
They celebrated the new-found peace for a few nights. Then the British
Camarilla began to act strange, the elders of the faction having been
Beckoned. The heads of the Triad all vanished.

The American Camarilla launched an assault against the disoriented
British Camarilla, now that they were weakened. For a few months, King
had praxis over Boston without the British influence. The anarchs acted
at some point taking out his allies in Worcester and setting up a
Barony. King focused on the war and worked to mend the Masquerade while
the American Camarilla clashed with the Giovanni. He was successful with
Kindred who were more low profile with their assets and lifestyles; it
deprived the Clan of Death of leverage. Soon Quentin Disappeared in
2014, assumed to have been beckoned away or assassinated.

The Clan of Death soon gave up with Andreas being the victim of a
ceremony gone wrong, the disappearance of the King, and the Reunion
taking place. They stepped back from the conflict completely. Now only a
few members of the clan remain and they operate on the fringes. Thanks
to Gehenna shaking the status quo and the young faction’s tenacity, the
American Camarilla are the victors of the war. At Quincy Market, they
officially dissolved the Kindred of Liberty to be the Boston Camarilla,
the new ruling faction of the land. [73][74][75]

### Swansong

The Kindred of Liberty worked to restructure the domain. The Primogen
was given more power, and Clan Malkavian were banned from holding any
Praxis in New England, with the Primogen seeing Quentin and Biltmore’s
clan as the cause of all the chaos in Boston. The throne of Boston sat
empty until
<a href="Hazel_Iversen" class="wikilink" title="Hazel Iversen">Hazel
Iversen</a> of Clan Ventrue had her praxis supported; Iversen was the
former Seneschal of the domain. The Primogen sought to manipulate her,
but she proved more willful than anticipated. She appointed her picks to
the Primogen and founded the Red Salon. The Red Salon was a feeding
place, her answer to the danger of traditional hunts in a modern city.
The Red Salon uses the “Invisibles” of society to provide blood for the
city, and Kindred in an invite-only style blood bar. One of many changes
she made.

Prince Iversen soon expanded the Red Salon operation. She was able to
use the empty domains of the elder to her advantage and gain more
political clout. She sought to re-establish Boston as the seat of power
for New England. Her first act was to combine the Boston Domain with the
Hartford Chantry, also folding them into her Red Salon operation for
their blood mastery.

A unification party was called with dignitaries such as
<a href="Victoria_Ash" class="wikilink" title="Victoria Ash">Victoria
Ash</a> even in attendance to celebrate this diplomatic victory. On the
night of the Unification Party, the party was brutally attacked. A Code
Red was called for those not in attendance yet to go to Prince’s Refuge.
Prince Iversen calls upon
<a href="Emem_Louis" class="wikilink" title="Emem">Emem</a>,
<a href="Galeb_Bazory" class="wikilink" title="Galeb">Galeb</a>, and
<a href="Leysha" class="wikilink" title="Leysha">Leysha</a> to
investigate and ensure the future of the domain.[76]
