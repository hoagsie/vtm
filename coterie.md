## How to set up a coterie

When players are creating characters for a chronicle it is strongly
recommended that they work together. During this collaborative process
they do have the option of forming a coterie, also known as a Kindred
team or group. A coterie aids both the players and the Storyteller as it
allows collective buy-ins to the chronicle and help indicate what
aspects in the World of Darkness that the players are interested in
pursuing.

A standard coterie pool begins with one free dot per player character,
lending to a small coterie pool to begin with which works well with
young hungry Kindred. There exists an optional rule, however, that
allows the use of Coterie Bonuses or just an increase to the starting
free coterie pool by two or three dots. This rule is useful for older
legacy coteries or for those simply wishing to play with more starting
dots.[1] A group with three or fewer players may be allowed to begin
with two free dots per character as determined by their Storyteller. In
addition, players may contribute their character's advantage dots to the
coterie's pool. The pool is spent collectively, however, in some groups
the players may choose to control how their contributions are spent. It
is also possible to purchase coterie flaws in order to obtain more dots
for the coterie during creation. Every player must agree to the flaw in
order for it to be taken.[2]

If the Storyteller permits for Domain Merits to be used, players can
purchase these with their Coterie Pool points. These dots count as both
Merits and Traits, for a coterie that has a two-dot Chasse Domain Merit
they do not need to purchase 2 dots in Chasse.[3]

## Domain

**Domain** is a core aspect of a coterie as it represents the physical
area in which the coterie can hunt. Within the Camarilla it is viewed as
a feudal fief and to the Anarchs it is their "turf". Each dot of Domain
cost one dot from the coterie's pool, these traits cover a lot of ground
so use them as abstractions rather than constraints.[4]

Without any domain, coteries may hunt by either poaching in another's
territory at their own risk or through a letter from the Prince or
another high official granting them temporary passage and the right to
hunt.[5]

### Chasse

A trait that describes how valuable the area is for hunting, be it
through vulnerable mortals or the richness of their blood. One dot of
this provides hunting grounds inside their domain at a hunting
difficulty of 6, with each additional dot lowering this by one. This
trait also refers to the size of the domain, with • being one city block
and ••••• being three neighborhoods with a large group of features such
as all the parks, all the hospitals, or all the convenience stores.[6]

A coterie that has cult members can benefit from an overlap of the
cult's area of influence. Known as **(•) Built-in Flock (Chasse)** they
can feed once per week at a set establishment with the hunting
Difficulty lowered by 1. If their domain overlaps with the local
Mirthraeum, they can take the merit **(••) Mithraeum (Chasse)** which
provides them with two dots of Haven Merits they can swap for other
Haven merits at the start of each story. An option flaw is included
**(••) Disputed Domain (Chasse)**, where they are overlapping with a
rival's territory and when encountering the opposing groups' member test
for fury frenzy.[7]

#### Chasse Merits

These merits are based on landmarks and features of the Domain,
increasing the ease of feeding within. [8]

### Lien

Another trait dictates how well the coterie has integrated into the
domain. Each dot of this adds one die to their pools on attempts to
interact peacefully with locals, locate something, gather the word on
the street, or investigate all within the area of the domain. Lien does
not modify the coterie hunting rolls.[9]

A coterie that has cult members can benefit from overlapping influence
with a merit known as **(•) Community Outreach (Lien)** which adds one
bonus die to all Manipulation and Subterfuge rolls when dealing with
mortals in the domain. (••) Visibility is an optional flaw that turns
all failed hunting tests into total failures and any rolls to conceal
the coterie's activities within the domain has its Difficulty increased
by 2.[10]

#### Lien Merits

These merits are based upon the coterie's ability to manipulate,
interact or otherwise control mortals within the Domain. grant bonuses
based around the type of actions the coterie wishes from the mortals in
the area.[11]

### Portillon

The last trait describes how secure the domain is against unwelcome
intrusions or disruptions be it other vampires, mortals, or the Second
Inquisition. This trait rarely adds to character pools, instead acting
as resistance against these forces. A critical success by an intruder
may lower the portillon of the domain against that specific group, at
least until the coterie deals with them. The portillon does not apply to
Havens inside or outside the domain.[12]

A coterie that has cult members can benefit from overlapping influence
with a merit known as **(•) Networked (Portillon)** which allows the
characters once per story to use the security cameras around the temple
to look at footage or ask the patrol of the temple to expand their route
for a few nights. In addition to this merit is the optional flaw of
**(•) Shared Vulnerabilities** which means regardless of the coterie's
precautions the cult's security is lax and enemies who take advantage of
this fact can ignore the Portillon rating as long as they breach the
cult's security first.[13]

#### Portillon Merits

Being the Domain's security and early warning system against intruders
these Merits help expand a coterie's options when they are at risk or
under attack.[14]

### Homesteading

This mechanic is used to factors in different parts of a city or region.
How their access to services or resources shape that location or
reputation. This can confer different benefits for operation in
different parts of the play area as determined by the ST and players. As
the story develops the rating may change as the Kindred and Coterie
interact with the city and affect the status quo. When utilizing this
system it is recommended players and STs work together on their system
when implementing. [15]

**Homesteads:** The areas of gameplay divided up in smaller areas as
determined by the ST: single havens, a city’s neighborhood, a region’s
cities, a town’s blocks, etc. Each homestead is divided by four aspects
and they reflect how Kindred or coterie sees the city, depending on the
STs application of the city. Homestead rating is the accumulative of the
four homestead traits.

Examples: havens, city blocks, neighborhoods, divisions of a city,
metropolitan areas of a region

**Areas of Import:** Can include ease of hunting, frenzy resist,
disciplines, attributes, or skills, this term is used to describe what
the homestead rating modifies.[16]

#### Homestead Traits

Each is rated on a scale of 0-5 and all add up for that homestead’s
score. The score affects how the homestead is affected in rolls and
areas of import.

- 0-5 - Provides -2 to area of import and +1 to a skill
- 6-10 - provides a -1 and +1 to area of import
- 11-15 - Provides +1 to any area of import and +1 to skill roll
- 16-20 - +2 to any area of import and a -1 to another area of import

**Affair:** The financial situation of the homestead; the property
value, taxes spent, and revenue. The financial sector or section of the
city filled with the workforce may rank high, while neglected or
underemployed portions of the city may rank lower.

**Association:** How that part of the city is integrated into the wider
city. How infrastructure, public services, and shops connect the people
to the homestead. Subways, highways, trendy restaurants, cultural
locations, etc. are things to consider.

**Clout:** The security physical embodiment of the locations and how it
can be interacted with by Kindred. A major landmark with a security
force may rank high in this trait, while a sleepy neighborhood where
they leave their doors unlocked could sit at 0.

**Utility:** Services provided and accessible to the homestead. It can
factor in things like air quality, public services responsiveness,
cleanliness, etc. Food desert may rank a place low, but to a Kindred if
the block has access to medical facilities they see it as highly ranked
in utility. [17]

## Coterie Advantages

These can only be taken with coterie dots or by taking coterie Flaws to
offset the cost. These Merits and Flaws affect this coterie wholly as
long as their allegiance is openly know, those who hide their
affiliation may avoid the Flaws but will also lack the Merits use.
Unlike character Advantages, these persist when the character who
purchased the Merit or Flaw is destroys or leaves the coterie, though
they will fade overtime.[18]

## Coterie Backgrounds

Coteries can purchase certain backgrounds and flaws in common using
their pool just as they would during standard character creation.
Remember to record major figures on the Relationship Map, just as is
done with individual backgrounds. Each member of the coterie can use
these backgrounds as if they were their own, however, the backgrounds
belong to the coterie and not the individual. Should a character leave
the coterie either through mutual splitting up or through ejection in
some form, they cannot take backgrounds with them. It is also important
to note that Backgrounds do not multiply, a two-dot coterie herd is
still the same as an individual's two-dot herd. Regardless of whether
being within a coterie's background or not, all backgrounds are subject
to in-game risks which means that putting all of it in one place can run
a risk should an enemy decide to take action against the characters.[19]

## Coterie Clan Merits

Kindred can also purchase Coterie Merits at Character Creation, these
are merits tied to specific clans but they can generally be activated by
anyone within the group. In some cases, only one member of the coterie
can use the given Merit in a session based on who needs it the most.[20]
