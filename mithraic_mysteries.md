## Overview

<section begin=summary/>

One of the most famous Methuselah cults, the Cult of Mithras, is
centuries old, led by their
[Ventrue](./ventrue.md) namesake.
Ever since
<a href="Mithras" class="wikilink" title="Mithras’">Mithras’</a>
disappearance the cult has been in disarray with no central figure to
push them: Patres with their own agenda plot, while loyal Patres are
paralyzed by indecision. The latter of the Patres are starting to hear
word of their lord’s return. The loyalists rebuild, preparing the way
for Mithras and to become significant power players in Kindred society.

The cult has ties to the ancient Roman and Persia days through the
founding of
[Londinium](./london_uk.md) to
modern night. Just as long lived as its central figure. Many cells fell
to Mithras’ supposed destruction, but those that survived with strong
leaders grew.

Though there are many aspects, above all the cult is one of law. It
stands for structure and order, secrets whispered, power wielded by the
strong, and an emphasis on training the young. The Cult wants to emulate
<a href="Mithras" class="wikilink" title="Mithras">Mithras</a>. They see
him as a god with spheres of influence from justice to conflict to
business to fertility. This serves the cult well as it has a variety of
benefits to entice different clans.

Mithraist believe enlightenment is attained through control. They
encourage strong convictions, touchstone, and humanity in each other to
make sure they can control their urges. Obeying elders, taking blood
bonds, and self sacrifice for the whole are all components of the
lucrative cult. [1]

### Hierarchy

The Mithraic Mysteries follows the Seven Steps to the Sun, which
measures someone’s ascension to be close to Mithras. Masks worn at
gatherings denotes the follower's rank

First Step: Corax, the Raven - the initiate cuts old bonds for the cult.

Second Step: Nympus, the Bride - They must learn of the cult’s enemies
or work as its spies.

Third Step: Miles, the Soldier - Combat Mithras’ enemies physically or
figuratively.

The Fourth Step: Leo, the Lion - They combat Mithras’ larger threats and
work as messengers to the cult's allies. They must pray to the sun.

The Fifth Step: Perses, the Persian - Tasked with growing Mithras’
influence.

The Sixth Step: Heliodromus, the Courier of the Sun - Assist Patres in
running the cult and are blood bound.

The Seventh Step: Pater - Father or Mother, is the head of a mystery
cell. Plan long term goals. Many are Princes.[2]

### Convictions

### Celebrations

Each cell has its own approach to worship, but these are considered a
core.[4]

- Bull Running - The Pater designates a target be it mortal, ghoul, or
  Kindred, which the initiates defeat. Defeat can by
  [Final Death](./final_death.md) or murder, but can also be financial ruin or public
  disgrace.[5]
- Fertility Feasts - Purpose is to channel the divine fertility of
  Mithras. This can be in the form of drugs, sexual acts, or however the
  cell interprets fertility. Though Kindred with Kindred is rare due to
  [Blood Bond](./blood_bond.md)
  concerns.[6]
- Blood Equinox - Late spring fasting where mortal members abstain from
  some indulgence, but Kindred feed just enough to stave off the
  <a href="Beast" class="wikilink" title="Beast">Beast</a>. At the
  Summer Solstice feast they go into a divine
  [Frenzy](./frenzy.md). Frenzying
  during the fast or not frenzying at the feast is looked down upon.[7]
- The Blooding - Bathing a member of in the Blood of a Pater and Mithras
  to denote them as an elite soldier. Not in modern era until Mithras
  returns.[8]
