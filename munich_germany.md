## Important Events

In the 13th century Munich was part of the Fiefdoms of the Black Cross,
ruled by Hardestadt of clan Ventrue. In the following two centuries
Munich Kindred fought against many enemies: prominent Italian Brujah and
[Lasombra](./lasombra.md),
Toreador dominated Courts of Love, and Lupine. After the formation of
the Camarilla the first Prince of that sect was a Brujah, Jann Berger,
in the 16th century. Berger was a tyrant and zealot executing or
dismissing those who questioned him. Under  the cover of the  Thirty
Years’ War, an assassination attempt was made on Berger, but he
survived. He led a series of executions until his childe assassinated
him, Jaroslav Pascek. Pascek would one day be a Justicar before the
Brujah left the sect. Paseck turned out to be a zealot Prince as well,
who survived many coups.

After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, the Tremere, Felix
Ritter, served as Prince. Ritter was famed for his successful campaigns
against the [Sabbat](./sabbat.md).
Ritter was callous, but willing to temper his brutality with diplomacy.
This allowed for a golden age of Camarilla influence in the city and
many in Ritter’s inner circle saw mobility in the sect. The Conclave of
1933 was a diplomatic moot between the Munich Court, Königs (German
branch family of the Giovanni), and the Anarch Movement to denounce
Keminitri’s crimes in Nymphenburg Palace.

World War II disrupted Kindred life and even scared them as they saw how
rapid humans could militarize. After the War, Ritter funneled money into
rebuilding effort and enjoying the success for another 60 years. In
2007, Then the city saw organized mortals as a danger again when the
German secret supernatural police, Grenzschutzgruppe 10 (GSG10), led an
assault on Munich wiping out half the kindred population. Rumor has it
Ritter and his brood were the first to die in this raid as well as the
Giovanni in Munich. Anarchs who survived fled the city.

Rumors of giving up on Munich were floated, but a Neonate Ventrue named
Ursula Eisenstadt, declared praxis on the kindred desolate city. She
stepped up security, banned electronics, and worked to hide kindred
society in Munich from the SI. The city is considered thriving now
thanks to the new modern regime. The Camarilla’s alliances with the
Hecata and Anarchs were forged to keep the city together.[24]
