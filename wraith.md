## Overview

Wraith. also called spirit or ghost are dead beings. Wraiths are
composed of lingering raw emotion of the dead meaning lack a physical
body or blood. They typically sustain damage from fire, sunlight,
focused bright lights, and blessed weapons and artifacts if the wielder
has

Spirits hardly show well on camera but can risk the

<a href="Oblivion" class="wikilink" title="Oblivion">Oblivion</a> and
<a href="Oblivion_Ceremonies" class="wikilink"

manipulate and harm ghosts.[1][2][3]

## In the Underworld

Many dwell in the
<a href="The_Underworld#The_Shadowlands" class="wikilink"
title="Shadowlands">Shadowlands</a> unable to interact with the world of
the living, but confined to watching. They look at loved ones or hated
enemies. Use of <a href="Oblivion_Ceremonies" class="wikilink"
title="Ceremonies">Ceremonies</a> can pull wraiths from across the
<a href="The_Underworld#The_Shroud" class="wikilink"
title="Shroud">Shroud</a>. Though those called like this, without
Ceremony binding them or a tear in the Shroud, they are pulled back to
the Underworld after a scene.[4][5]

Passing the shroud is impossible for wraiths; they typically need a
Ceremony to pull them through. Some rare spirits are thankful for a
chance to be in the Skinlands as they can resolve business or flee
spectral aggressors. Calling a wraith that is on the other side of the
world still requires them to travel to the caster's relative location in
the Shadowlands to cross.[6]

The true Underworld is where the wraiths live, their home cities called
necropoli. Only those with extremely sophisticated Ceremonies and a
ghostly sponsor may enter this level. They can be dangerous to
<a href="Kindred" class="wikilink" title="Kindred">Kindred</a> as they
can drain a vampire’s
<a href="Willpower" class="wikilink" title="Willpower">Willpower</a> in
the land of the dead and have the Abyss consume them.[7][8]

## Parts of a Wraith

### Fetter

A fetter can be an object, location, or even people that are important
to a wraith. It is integral ingredient in many
<a href="Oblivion_Ceremonies" class="wikilink"
title="Oblivion Ceremonies">Oblivion Ceremonies</a>, especially if one
is to simply call a particular wraith.[9]

Knowing a ghost’s fetters enables necromancers to manipulate the dead
better. Fetters can also be used to enslave ghosts to a necromancer’s
will through Ceremonies. Those utilized this way have an eternal
vendetta against such
<a href="Oblivion" class="wikilink" title="Oblivion">Oblivion</a> users.
Harming a fetter in front of a called ghost can can damage it sense of
being so severely it is sent back to the Underworld and devolves into a
spectre.[10]

### Passion

Wraiths have no blood or body, instead they have raw emotions that are
called passions. They usually have less than five, but some rare wraiths
have more. Passions can be any emotional driving force: love, hate,
greed, vengeance. Some Oblivion necromancers can even drain the Wraiths
of these passions to sate their
<a href="Hunger_system" class="wikilink" title="Hunger">Hunger</a>. A
wraith losing their passions dulls their sense of being. A wraith
drained of passions start down the path of self destruction. They may
turn into chaotic and murderous spectre when their passions have
emptied.[11]

## Types of Ghosts

  <a href="Auspex#Possession" class="wikilink"
  title="Possession">Possession</a>
  <a href="Disciplines" class="wikilink" title="Discipline">Discipline</a>
  power. In the Shadowlands, they have control issues.[15]
- **Screamer** - These wraiths are angry manifestations as yells, wails,
  and more in the Skinlands. In the Shadowlands, they are charming
  sirens who can flip moods rapidly.[16]
- **Spectres** - Maybe drained of their passions or had their fetters
  destroyed. They have lost something dear to them and are filled with
  rage. They take their anger out on all, using telekinesis
  and possessions as their tools.[17][18]
- **Gede** - Not all loa are ghosts, some ghosts are loa according to
  the Samedi/Nayson San an. A gede is an ancestor spirit the bloodline
  often called on to commune with and even allow a
  <a href="Oblivion_Ceremonies#Host_Spirit" class="wikilink"
  title="possession">possession</a>; they prefer usually this over
  enslaving ghosts.[19]
- **Fury** - A usually invisible spirit bound by a sorcerer or
  necromancer to a location. Attacks trespassers after a warning, then
  plagues them with Torture, mind games, and manifestations. Can be
  banished or destroyed like others, but can not be enslaved as it is
  already bound.[20]
- **Skinlock** - A ghost that manipulates the minds of others that a
  dead loved one is actually alive. They pose as the dead and live in
  their home keeping all under the illusion. It doesn’t actually have a
  body; they are intangible and just alter the minds of others.[21]
