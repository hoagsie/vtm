## Overview

Kharkiv is a domain that has experienced the odd shift from being a
<a href="Camarilla" class="wikilink" title="Camarilla">Camarilla</a>
domain to being an
<a href="Anarch" class="wikilink" title="Anarch">Anarch</a> domain. It
is a city that is under the influence of the
<a href="Church_of_Set" class="wikilink" title="Church of Set">Church of
Set</a>.

The Prince abdicated their throne only for a Baron to immediately rise
in their place. The Primogen Council dissolved, with the Primogen
members joining a more inclusive council of elders. The Sheriff who
opposed this change disappeared one night.

This has all been a grand display of what happens when the leaders and
power players of the city are enraptured with the Church of Set ideals.
For years the major figures of the city were manipulated by the cult,
pushed to the brink of the
<a href="Beast" class="wikilink" title="Beast">Beast</a> then pulled
from the edge with Set’s teachings. Those that resisted or realized the
manipulation were either horrified to find their allies had already
converted or have conveniently “disappeared” after a visit from a member
of the Church.[1]

## Notable People and Groups

- **<a href="Church_of_Set" class="wikilink" title="Church of Set">Church of
  Set</a>** - The Church of Set in Kharkiv doesn't care which sect rules
  the city, but that the
  <a href="Kindred" class="wikilink" title="Kindred">Kindred</a> left
  are followers of Set; lacking the desire for political positions or to
  be political advisors. Their tactics and methods were built off of and
  improved upon <a href="Indianapolis,_Indiana" class="wikilink"
  title="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>’ success, but improved upon the
  perceived failure in their eyes of the “all faiths accepted” approach.
  They use the terms “believer” for those saved, "non-believer" for
  those to be targeted, and “the lost” for those in need of pity,
  isolation, or to be erased. They are led by a loose hierarchy with
  priest role as the pinnacle and rest warriors role and believers.
  Three of the
  <a href="Church_of_Set" class="wikilink" title="Setite">Setite</a>

- **Main Setite Temple** - One-story grey building in the industrial
  side of town in the Kyivskyi District. It is only open to those fully

  night with no intention to give into that indulgence again. Acts such
  as drugs,

  is safe to use church terms, after one museum had the oldest intact
  enamel sculpture of Set.[14]
