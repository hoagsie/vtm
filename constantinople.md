## Overview

While modernly known as [Istanbul, Turkey](./istanbul_turkey.md). Many kindred outside the
Ashirra refer to it by its old Byzantine name, Constantinople, for its
representation of the
[Toreador](./toreador.md)
Methuselah's idealized city of kindred harmony, the Dream of
Constantinople. The city was ruled over by the triumvirate kindred
coterie known as the Trinity. The city fell to a combination of
[Setite’s](./ministry.md)
corrupting influence, methuselah's mania,
[diablerie](./diablerie.md) of
Michael by Mary the Black, and the sacking via the Fourth Crusade
shattering the Dream after a near millennia. Some still hope for the
Dream to be reborn either in Istanbul or a new place on earth.[1][2][3]

## The Trinity

The Trinity were composed of three philosopher Kindred and lovers:
Michael, Antonius, and the Dracon. Michael was a Toreador Methuselah who
styled himself as the Archangel, it was his Dream which is coterie and
lovers strived to make a reality.  Antonius was of Clan
[Ventrue](./ventrue.md), known as
the master planner and builder known as a great architect; he helped
create many buildings and political structures of the city. The third
member, The Dracon, was described as a passionate and wise
[Tzimisce](./tzimisce.md). He
was the spiritual guide of the Trinity and focused on
transcendence.[4][5]

Michael was diablerized by a kindred named Mary the Black.[6][7] though
rumors say he stirs in his diablerist and even
[reached out](./beckoning.md)
to his descendants to form the
[Nephilim](./nephilim.md).[8]
Antonius  was murdered during the Constantinople days. The Dracon is the
only survivor of the Trinity after Constantinople’s fall. Some whisper
he takes a new form. While his intent is unclear, many hope he helps to
bring forth the Dream again.[9][10]

## The Dream

Michael the Archangel had an idealized vision for Kindred society; him
and the rest of the Trinity molded Constantinople to exemplify Michael’s
vision. The Dream was an idea that all kindred of different beliefs and
backgrounds could live in a harmonious society. Furthermore, Michael
encouraged Kindred to grow further from the Beast to be more than simply
predators. He encouraged them to seek enlightenment and learn. Humans
gave their blood willingly to their veiled kindred masters.[11][12]

## Legacies of the Trinity

The code of laws (also called Codex of Legacies) of Constantinople, was
similar to modern day
[Traditions](./camarilla.md#the-traditions).[13]

I. The Legacy of Trinity - Ensure acknowledgement of the Trinity's
authority and ability to make new domain laws. Also say it is their
responsibility to voice concerns of their Scions.

II\. The Legacy of Progeny - Only Trinity can sire. Even Scion families
must petition the right. Breaking of this law can result in destruction
of childe and banishment of the sire.

III\. The Legacy of Founding - Only the Trinity can grant domain, but
some cainites are given domain to embrace. Those who get a domain must
enforce the Codex of Legacies.

IV\. The Legacy of Shadow - The Trinity must be worshipped as deities,
but their true nature should never be revealed.

V. The Legacy of Ashes - Death of a family member is not allowed unless
approved by the Trinity. Violators will meet final death. However those
not of the Scion families are not offered this protection.

## Legacy

- [Nephilim](./nephilim.md) -
  Started as Michaels brood in Constantinople who spread their
  ancestor's idea of beauty and dispersed after the the Dream's end.
  Modern nights, Michael bloodline was beckoned to Istanbul and those
  present shared a vision to spread his worship. Now they work to
  venerate the Toreador Methuselah and spread his ideas of beauty and
  perfection.[14]
- Angels of Vengeance - A heresy of the Nephilim. Zealous extremists who
  seek to punish those who brought down Constantinople and those who
  deny the Dream.[15]
- Speakers of the Dream -  Not a cult but Kindred who study the Dream
  and seek to spread the ideals of distance from the Beast and seeking
  enlightenment.[16]
- [Istanbul, Turkey](./istanbul_turkey.md) - The city itself is
  still reeling from the time when the Trinity rules. They hope the
  Dream and a new Trinity will rise once again.[17]
