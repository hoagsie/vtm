## Overview

<section begin=summary/>

The Church of Set contains Setites who want to liberate vampires from
societal structures and help them find their true selves. Many fall to
Beast and become a
[Wight](./humanity.md#humanity-0),
but they prove to be valuable learning lessons for the next groups of
inductees. Those who survive the Setites believe they become stronger
for it. Some see the orthodox Church of Set as a cult of chaos
advocating against hierarchies, but others see it as some sage wisdom to
be beholden to no master only learned by age old vampires.

<section end=summary/>

Followers of what some claim to be the oldest Kindred religion. Known as
the Follower of Set due to a very literal translation of Arabic, they
are known as the Church of Set these night. The
[Ministers](./ministry.md)
of this cult are thought to be connected by Blood, founder, and
religious practices. With a clan origin steeped in legend and divinity,
[Hecata](./hecata.md), Ministry,
and [Malkavian](./malkavian.md)
history records confirm Set has not  been seen since 33 BCE. Their
worship has taken on many forms and coopted many movements to survive
into the modern day. In modern nights there was a schism between the
Blood and the Church. Ministers are the ones who have shed ties to the
Church and even some to the Red God, Set, himself. Most of the clan are
now Ministers, the Setites of the blood label these individuals as
heretics.

Domains with a temple to Set know the place will have access to
enlightenment, advice, and some tough truths. Some lost Kindred even
come to these temples for meaning in their unlife. The Church appeals to
vampiric base nature and promises to remove the worst of such desires. A
tempting offer when considering the only other choice seems like
stagnation. Such paths should be taken with caution.

The Church has Gates and Hours, ways to keep track of a Kindred or
kine’s progression into reaching enlightenment as well as how they
organize their institution. Many converts don’t realize a Setite has put
them on the path of recruitment until it is too late. Their temples
usually have one priest and one warrior, but can have more. Witches used
to be a role, but is now lost, though converted
[Bahari](./bahari.md) cover that
role nicely. Converting their flock and spreading liberation are their
main goals in domains. The main leaders of the Church are the
Hierophants in the active Founding Temples. Though they may still have
sway over the Ministry as a whole.[1]

## History

The history of the Church of Set varies in origin and is mixed with
mythology. Millennia before
<a href="Caine" class="wikilink" title="Caine">Caine</a> and Abel, there
was a divine family that ruled earth with the precursors to the
Followers of Set. The founding myth of the Church of Set varies on Set’s
divine origins spending on translations and interpretation. There are
many fragments to these legends. The Church finds the metaphor more
valuable than a linear narrative of a story. Many priests boiled down to
the main points that there is sin against truth and Set is passed over
as rightful ruler.[2][3]

A popular version claims that in the city of Annu, the First City, Ra
lived and grew weak. Ra had to choose a successor and opted for Osiris
over Set. Set was war ready as he warred with Apep multiple times and
Osris was a weak scholar in Set’s eyes. Set opened his eyes to the truth
that all people are gods trapped in mortal bodies, none are lesser than
Ra. He rallied his twelve disciplines to slay Osiris. He dismembered
Osiris and spread his body over all of Egypt. Set neglected Osiris’ wife
Isis, the goddess of magic; She collected Osiris and rebuilt him. Osiris
and Isis joins in marital union to create Horus. Ra named Horus king and
God.

With Horus as successor, Set’s plan failed. Set was captured, slain, and
exiled to the Egyptian land of the dead, the Duat. Osiris was the new
ruler of the Underworld now. How this version ends has its own versions.
Some versions say he made a deal with Apep. One claims Apep bit Set’s
heart and laid the curse of vampirism. Others say he killed Apep in one
on one combat. Either way, Set gained Apep’s massive power by consuming
the great snake’s heart. Set fought his way out of the underworld, now
neither dead nor alive. He had a curse of eternal hunger for blood and
burns under the eyes of Horus. He freed his imprisoned disciples and fed
them his Blood. His goal was to lure humanity from the light of God’s
Tyranny and have a war against Horus’ heaven.[4][5]

Other versions place Set hailed as warrior, would be king, master of
storms, and many other titles. Some label Set as a betrayer of his kin
as the previous legend; either killed Osiris via drowning or
dismemberment. Other versions Set is betrayed by Osiris; either tricked,
attacked, or steal Set’s consort so Osiris could steal rule. Then there
is the other myth that perhaps Set never wanted to rule, but take down
Ra’s corrupted court.[6]

Throughout the era while Set ruled the clan, the Hierophants saw them
through many pharaohs and invasions. They survived the Macedonians and
the Ptolemaic Dynasty.

Set’s last appearance was in 33 BCE, where he caused earthquakes and
storms that shook the palace of Memphis. He delivered his final mystery
to his faithful. When Hierophants and witches visited his resting place
they found a vacant obsidian sarcophagus shattered to pieces and
embedded into the walls. The ancient Hierophants took over the clan and
did as they had in eras past. None truly posed a threat to the high
priests of the Church of Set specifically. As Set was the god of
foreigners, there was more to gain from the changing times.

In the 1200s, the Purge of Baybars began; the first true challenge to
the Church in the form of Sultan Baybars. The Sultan led an inquisition
a full century before the
[First Inquisition](./anarch.md#first-inquisition). Sultan Baybars did not
stop at European crusaders. He sent his Mamluks to destroy Kindred
temples and destroyed two Setite Methuselahs. The Sultan’s forces were
able to sack the founding temple, Temple Ombos. These events resulted in
the Proclamation of Red Tears; when the Church of Set was driven into
exile out of Egypt. The Setites attempted to take as many artifacts as
they could save from the destruction.  

For forty years the clan was a diaspora. They found while European
kindred despised them for their skin, faith, and acts; these foreign
Kindred loved what the Setities could get them. The simple trade of
things like silk, spices, and rare animals started to swell up the
Church’s treasury. The Setities was more than happy to wet the European
appetites, expanding into opiates, hashish, and servants. Even that
evolved into more abstract goods, forgeries, political plots, rare
items, etc. The church had grown a wide network of fixers,
collaborators, and traders. The Church learned much in this exile: they
organized their connection, kept stock of member's skills, recorded
resources of each temple, and learned to manipulate those indebted to
the Church. This allowed them to weather the First Inquisition, with
bribed clergy and redirecting hunters.[7]

During the formation of the
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md),
the Ministry had a chance to join. The Setite Hierophant attended to
represent the clan but ultimately declined on the clan joining.[8][9]

In the Renaissance era and Age of Reason, the Church prospered in an age
of challenged norms, secret societies, and sought after exotic
materials. During the Enlightenment, the Church prospered and spread to
ports and palaces as the New World was explored and revolutions spread.
The Church had a history of playing both sides of a conflict. As they
are a cult based on rejection of tyranny, many have flirted with the
idea of the
[Anarchs](./anarch.md). Though
the cult members are encouraged to not cling to a sect.[10]

In the 2000s, the Red Star appeared in the sky. Many witches and
scholars of the cult concluded the Set no longer slumbers. As
<a href="Gehenna" class="wikilink" title="Gehenna">Gehenna</a> and the
[Second Inquisition](./second_inquisition.md) heated up the Church
of Set and then independent Clan Ministry felt the pressure.
[Beckoning](./beckoning.md)
took many of the ruling Church and clan members, and the strongholds in
Egypt and surrounding countries were being invaded by other Kindred
because of the Gehenna War. The Church organized entry into the
Camarilla. The talks happened in
[Paris](./paris_france.md), but
those talks were interrupted via the Paris bombing. The Camarilla denied
their entry.[11]

The Church used to be so synonymous to
[Clan Ministry](./ministry.md), but this event caused a schism. Though there is some
confusion on if the division happened before or after the Paris bombing.
Be that as it may after the bombing, the schism intensified. The Church
sees the Ministry as evidence of fractions, others see it as unofficial
“lay ministry”, and some see the Ministry as the Church's new lightning
rod. Though some rumors say the schism is a grand manipulation, with the
Church and Clan truth is hard to ascertain. Though the Orthodox Setites
stay away from Sects generally while the Ministry usually have affinity
with the Anarch Movement and other sect politics.[12][13]

## Structure and beliefs

### Mysteries

**The Lesser Mystery of Set** - Less intimate and done each month on the
full moon. The priest hosting the mystery will make a revelation and
display either magic, ancient artifact, or some entertaining display to
stoke rebellion. Sacrifices are made, though largely symbolic typically
and called something else. These events have priest gauge who is a fit
for a Gate of Wisdom and further revelations.

**The Mysteries of the Nine Gates of Wisdom** - A series of
transformative lessons. Each calls on learning truths or gaining
experiences meant to strip an initiate's mind down.

**The Greater Mystery of Set** - With few written records and words to
outsiders considered heresy, this yearly worship takes up multiple
nights. Those of the Fourth Hour at least and have experienced a Lesser
Mystery are expected to participate. A first night of feasts, the second
of prayer and cleansing, the third night of fasting only allowed to feed
on those on entheogens, the fourth night is a mystery to those outside
the mystery, and the final night is a catharsis of hours long feast,
fighting, orgies, and drugs. What conspires here is kept secret under
penalty of Contending.[14]

**Burning of Baybars** - A yearly ceremony held in mostly Egyptian,
Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern Temples, and rare occasions Western
temples. To celebrate the death of Sultan Baybars in 1277, the Setites
go through a litany, hold a piece of his preserved bone over the fire,
and the priest summons the
[wraith](./wraith.md) of Baybars.
The flock jeers him and relish his pain while his spirit burns in the
fire.[15]

### Hierarchy

#### Nine Gates of Wisdom

The Mysteries of the Nine Gates of Wisdom is a cornerstone of the Church
of Set religion. Passing through these gates is required to advance
through the Church hierarchy. Awareness of being guided through a gate
isn’t necessary, but a well executed task is. While there is no solid
order on the, many suggest the Gate of Ecstasy first and many hold Gate
of Blood as essentially to join the Church formally as a Embrace into
the Ministry or a symbolic act seals the initiate’s dedication to the
Red God for those converts outside the Ministry. The path one is lead on
by a priest is individualized largely.

Of course invoking such strong feelings can cause a vampire to
[Frenzy](./frenzy.md),
[Stain](./humanity.md#stains), or
enter wightdom, the Church will usually cover up such failings.
Discounting such vampires as unworthy.

The Gates are as follows:[16]

- **Ecstasy** - Usually the first Gate since it is easier to introduce
  and almost expected of the Church. The aim of the Gate is to be a
  sensory experience that awakens their body and smothers their ego.
- **Terror** - Many times the second Gate. The goal is to let the
  initiate’s id express itself. Give the initiate such a scare, but
  angle the Church and Set as their relief.
- **Wrath** - Push the initiate to the point their rage explodes. The
  goal is to help destroy their “false self”.
- **Desire** - Has the initiate indulge in all their desires. Make the
  initiate question why such wants are taboo or discouraged. Make them
  question why they should suppress their urges.
- **Satiety** - Has the initiate indulge until they can no longer
  indulge. Now the thought of partaking in what they formerly desired
  becomes repellant.
- **Despair** - Orchestra the initiate losing all they used to hold dear
  and vital: possessions, wealth, playmates, loves, etc. This is to
  teach them nothing external to their soul can truly define who they
  are.
- **Ignorance** - Have the initiate experience life-changing doubt via a
  shattering revelation. The initiate realizes a fundamental foundation
  of their identity was built on a lie.
- **Chaos** - The initiate is shown the world is a lie. The world lacks
  reasons and sense. Only Set and his church are the proper home for
  such belief.
- **Blood** - Considered the most sacred and vital Gate. Become a life
  sacrifice to the Red God via Set’s agent, the Setite guiding the
  initiate. This is essentially the
  <a href="Embrace" class="wikilink" title="Embrace">Embrace</a>. After
  the sire has deep contemplation and the newly Embraced fledgling
  celebrates their rebirth. For those already Embraced, the Gate of
  Blood is done as a symbolic re-enactment showing their “second
  Embrace” into Set.

#### Hours

The Church sees Hours as where souls are in their journey and has it
symbolize Ra’s decent into the Duat.

First Hour - Potential converts and curious Individuals. Take them to a
Lesser Mystery of Set.

Second Hour - Initiate after passing Gate of Ecstasy usually, or first
gate as decided by priest.

Third Hour - Initiate starts to feel chaos and uncertainty. Two more
Gates of Wisdom experienced as they are guided on their path.

Fourth Hour - Church coerces more service and screens initiate's
relationships. The Church gets much of their labor from mortals in this
Hour. Kindred are promised great revelations.

Fifth Hour - Opened four Gates of Wisdom. Confirmation and induction
into the Church, they may study doctrine. Many only now realized they
were being initiated.

Sixth Hour - Must have mastered six Gates of Wisdom. May guide others
through gate they have mastered. Full time member of Church.

Seventh Hour - Eight Gates of Wisdom mastered. Warriors may never pass
this Hour, forever missing the final Gate. A Setite may open and manage
a local temple. .

Eight Hour - Mastery of all Nine Gates of Wisdom. Upper level of the
Church with High Priest and Hierophants of older temples.

Ninth Hour - Member of the highest echelons of the Church. High Priests
of Founding temples guide the Church body. Many are the oldest
followers, though the
[Beckoning](./beckoning.md) has
taken some.

Tenth Hour - Considered Demigods. Methuselah from time passed, many
thought to be asleep. None have been heard of since the Beckoning.

Eleventh Hour - Set waits here to lead his Followers to the Final Hour.

Final Hour - Primordial Nun. Supposedly where he faithful can make a new
world or find a new one. None have passed to this hour according to
Church doctrine.[17]

### Convictions

The Church emphasizes experience and ritual over official doctrine, but
there are some ideas that float through the church for the newly
initiated. These aren't commandment but litany to easily memorize some
doctrine themes.

• Always strive to liberate others of their vices

• Never refuse aid to another member of the Church

• Always respect the commands of those in later Hours

• Always do what is necessary to test another’s resistance to liberation

• Always seek the mysteries of Set, hidden throughout the world

• Always do what is necessary to test the flaws in a social order [18]

## Notable Members

**Djedefre**,
[Ministry](./ministry.md) -
In the Ministry-controlled
[Indianapolis](./indianapolis_in.md), Djedefre is an old school Setite
who still follows the Church of Set teachings. He runs the temple St.
Isaac of the Runes where his adherents attend. He is dismissive of the
non-Setite Ministers, seeing their outlook as a set back to the Church’s
mission. He thinks the Church should go underground while the Schism
plays out with the Ministers as the face. He appears as an elderly black
gentleman in a wheelchair, but he is an elder Kindred with a fanatically
loyal following. If he realizes Melvyn Ramsay has been destroyed, he
will attempt to avenge him.[19] [20]

**Reverend Twosret**,
[Ministry](./ministry.md) -
Originally a southern preacher named Sarah P Donnadieu. She was Embraced
into the Ministry and the Church of Set. She became a hardliner and
fanatic of the Setite Orthodoxy, growing alarmed at the clan’s schism,
the
[Beckoning](./beckoning.md),
and Minister’s alignment with the
[Anarchs](./anarch.md). She
travels to different domains to “right the course” of the clan. She sees
the Ministry schism and Beckoning as a test from Set. She considered the
non-Setite Ministry and Anarch Movement as lesser forms of rebellion.
She plots to destroy the prominent
[Chicago](./chicago_ill.md)
Ministry member, Marcel, for being a heretic. She will use Salt to this
end.[21]
