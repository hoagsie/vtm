## How to use coterie types

Players have the option to create their coterie type from those below or
invent their own. Below are examples of possible types with names that
serve as a shorthand rather than a universal term amongst Kindred. Yes,
some may call their coterie a Nomad, but they do not have to. Build the
coterie around what the troupe desires first and rules second. If a
coterie type matches well, use it's requirements but if there are things
the players would rather have instead, swap it around with different
pre-requisites. In a similar vein, coterie types can change in play.
Perhaps the Nomad coterie has found a city they wish to settle down in,
changing around their advantages will help represent their current
storyline.[1]

Mechanically when using these types, subtract the listed costs from the
coterie pool. If the pool isn't large enough to pay the costs of that
type, start collecting contributions from the characters. You can
increase any listed value with your remaining coterie pool if there is
any. Consider the possible extras as more places to put the remaining
pool.[2]

At the Storytellers discretion some coterie types grant a single dot
bonus to one of the domain traits if the coterie meets all the
pre-requisites listed. This bonus does not raise a domain trait above
five, if a coterie changes types or otherwise changes to receive a bonus
that would increase the trait above five either refund a coterie dot or
the experience spent by a player character.

**Coteries that can gain this bonus:**

  Questari, Regency, Sbirri
- Lien: Champions, Corporate, Family, Gatekeeper, Vehme

dot to Contacts or Retainers.[3]
