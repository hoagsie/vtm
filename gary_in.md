## Overview

<section begin=summary/>

Gary, Indiana is a city close to
[Chicago](./chicago_ill.md),
southeast along the shores of Lake Michigan. A victim of the steel
industry restructuring and the many layoffs that followed, it has become
another city in the Rust Belt. Many of the manufacturing buildings were
abandoned and left to rust, and now Gary caught in a battle between the
encroaching
[Camarilla](./camarilla.md)
Kindred and the Anarchs who call it home.

<section end=summary/>

[1] Currently, the city is predominantly
[Anarch](./anarch.md).

## Prominent Locations

### The Wasteland

This unofficial neighborhood stretches along the waterfront and east to
the dockyards. The Wasteland contains masses of graffitied steel
buildings, abandoned mills, and waste facilities. Used as a place for
immoral businessmen, cunning criminals, vagrants, and kindred. This
makes it hard to navigate, which is ideal for the Anarchs. An abandoned
steel mill is used by the Gary Anarchs as their secret HQ dubbed The
Hall. The Hall is in the heart of the Wasteland and is the major base of
operations for all Gary Anarchs. [16][17][18]

### City Methodist Church

Founded in 1926, it once was the largest Methodist church in the
Midwest, but closed permanently in 1975.It stands guarded by wires and
in seeming disrepair. Formerly, this was a spot where the circulatory
used to transport vessels. [19]

### The Depot

Gary is a major trade hub in the
[Circulatory System](./circulatory_system.md)’s network; they have
designated a new primary stop in the domain. Former warehouse that used
to be owned by Aetna Powder Company, vessels are sold or moved through
this location. The location is empty when not in use, as the Circulatory
System operatives are careful. Baron Stephens dislikes this practice,
but turns a blind eye for now while she looks to build a power base.
[20]

### The Dive

A biker bar located in Glen Park. Baron Stephens owns the building,
using it for various business meetings and as a place to relax. Other
than the Wasteland, this is the second most prominent Anarch hangout.
[21]

## Important Events

Gary was an industrial cornerstone of the Midwest. In 1906, the United
States Steel Corporation was founded in Gary, Indiana. Becoming one of
the city’s most prosperous industries. The Toreador, Modius, has his
failed coup of Lodin in 1913 and flees to Gary, Indiana thanks to secret
aid from his sire, Annabelle. There Modius sets up a new Princedom, as a
consolation for Chicago.

In 1919, a steel worker strike happened that lasted for 110 days and
ended in a riot. Governor Goodrich declares martial law and ends the
demonstration. Lodin started the Interdiction in 1921, a campaign headed
by his childer, Horatio Ballard and Al Capone, to wear away at Modius’
power base. Capone’s mafia moved in on unions, public officials got
corrupted, and they tore away at the city little by little. [22]

In 1960 the steel industry crashed and caused rampant unemployment. The
city lost 2/3’s of its population from 1960 at 180,000 to 2010 at
80,000. With all these hits taken and multiple gambits lost, eventually
Modius surrendered to Lodin, allowing Modius to keep the crown, but
effectively be a laughing stock. Regarded as the Pauper Prince of a
domain that lost power and relevance.

After the War of Chicago, with Lodin thought dead, Modius thought it was
his chance, but the Anarch leader Juggler turned out to be an opponent
for Gary itself. Juggler too was a failed usurper of Chicago now in
Gary, Indiana. The Camarilla population for Gary was small by 1999.
Meanwhile, Juggler built an army of kindred those pushed out of Chicago
and the disenfranchised in Gary. He gained a reputation for fighting the
Camarilla and the
[Sabbat](./sabbat.md). The rivalry
between Juggler and Modius got so intense they started to attract the
attention of various hunters groups and harm the city itself.

Juggler's influence on a well-received movie that subtly took jabs at
the Camarilla, aided in elevating his status and pushing Anarchs in the
Free States to recognize his efforts. Though Anarchs of higher echelons
saw this, the Chicago Anarchs especially Anarch Center (Like Anita and
Maldavis) saw him as too arrogant and self serving to lead. Modius
struck back at Juggler now that his Chicago support was iced out; their
fighting caused more and more woes for Gary as their mortal pawns
fought.

In 2014, Modius, desperate for an upper hand, manipulated a vampire
hunter, Sullivan Dane, to enter Gary. Dane ashed many vampires and
forced many into hiding. Word leaked of what Modius did supposedly by
his childe, Allicia, causing Modius to lose remaining public support.
Juggler cut a secret deal with Annabelle; Gary becomes a Free State if
Juggler agrees to never attack Chicago, offer a series of boons, and
spare her childe’s life. The Brujah agreed and captured Modius. Juggler
officially became the Baron of Gary for a time, then disappeared.

Now Juggler’s childe, Evelyn Stephens, is Baron of Gary with an uneasy
grip on the city. The two elders Modius and Juggler have completely
vanished. [23] With Gary stabilizing there are concerns of rogue attacks
on Chicago’s Circulatory System.
<a href="Kevin_Jackson" class="wikilink" title="Prince Jackson">Prince
Jackson</a> and Baron Stephens don’t want another war, but the culprit
needs to be found out, and the opposite party cleared. [24]

The Vanguard, a coterie of Camarilla hardliners, has taken residence in
parts of the city the Anarchs have yet to reclaim: Brunswick, West Side,
and Black Oak. [25] An investigation was launched into the attacks, the
culprit is revealed to be Maxwell the former Prince of Chicago. Maxwell
has long planned to Chicago from Lodin and his progeny, and is going to
extreme means to secure it. His actions and fate will have
transformative effects on the city, the kine, and the Kindred power
structure. [26]
