## Overview

<section begin=summary/>

A relatively new cult, the Cult of Shalim loves to find
<a href="kindred" class="wikilink" title="kindred">kindred</a> with
connections, dreams, loves, then slowly pull at the Kindred mind of the
futility of it all. To them the core tenet of their faith, reality is
suffering. Almost similar to the
<a href="Church_of_Set" class="wikilink" title="Church of Set">Church of
Set</a>, but there are no sins of the flesh or indulgences, just the
void. The belief that to get rid of suffering one must also get rid of
joy. Utopia cannot exist while the world exists. This nihilism comes
from the many
<a href="Lasombra" class="wikilink" title="Lasombra">Lasombra</a>
mystics who have stared into
<a href="The_Underworld#The_Abyss" class="wikilink"
title="the Abyss">the Abyss</a> for too long.

It is said an ancient
<a href="Lasombra" class="wikilink" title="Lasombra">Lasombra</a>,
Apolleon the Traveler, travels around the earth as a big black mass
whispering to his bloodline revelation of the Abyss. Especially to those
who survived great tragedy and traumas, nothing awaits them and they are
all bound in <a href="The_Underworld#The_Abyss" class="wikilink"
title="Oblivion">Oblivion</a>. Oblivion will end their suffering and the
suffering of the world.

They are taught Shalim was the first kindred and master of nothingness.
Once this Shalim awakens he will return the world to null and all will
become Shalim. They work as covert presence in domains, they are already
in the the United Kingdom, Brazil, South Africa, and Egypt where they
secretly exploit the division within
<a href="the_Ministry" class="wikilink" title="the Ministry">the
Ministry</a> and work to manipulate them to Shalim’s purposes.[1]
