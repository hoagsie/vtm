**Brujah** are one of the fourteen vampire clans of Vampire: The
Masquerade. The Brujah are a clan of radicals and troublemakers,
<a href="Embrace" class="wikilink" title="Embracing">Embracing</a> those
willing to put someone in their place if the situation calls for it.
Most see themselves as warriors with a cause, and these Rebels are
guided by their passions, strength, and dedication to their ideals —
whatever those may be.[1]

Brujah are generally Embraced from the ranks of those who are
sympathetic to those who do not back down. Seeking out others who
question the status quo and welcome countercultures. From spirited
fighters to critical thinkers, the clan is bolstered by their ability to
withstand the storm and persevere through hardships. The Brujah are
commonly misplaced as the street punks or anarchists who are looking for
nothing but trouble. However, this is far from the truth. [2]

## Disciplines

Below are the powers innate to the Brujah as well as the uses they find
in it.

- **Celerity** allows the Brujah to strike fast and move even faster
  when the situation becomes too dangerous.
- **Potence** gives them the strength behind their attacks, bolstering
  their swings and allowing them to use fists rather than words to sway.
- **Presence** is never the last resort with a Brujah. Giving them an
  edge when attempting to use words rather than physical violence to
  make their point.

## Bane

<section begin="bane" />

**Violent Temper** - A rage is simmering in the back of the mind with a
Brujah with the slightest provocation able to send them into a frenzied
rage. Subtracts dice equal to the
[Bane Severity](./banes.md#bane-severity) of the Brujah against Fury Frenzy.

## Variant Bane

<section begin="altbane" />

**Violence** - When a messy critical occurs as the result of any Skill
test outside of combat, a Brujah vampire causes damage to the subject of
their interaction equal to their Bane Severity, in addition to any other
result of the Hunger dice. The type of damage is dependent on the
situation either physical or mental. The damage is Aggravated unless the
player spends a point of
[Willpower](./willpower.md) to
turn it into Superficial.

[4]

## Compulsion

<section begin="compulsion" />

**Rebellion** - The Brujah craves to take a stance against those who
represent the status quo. This does not relent until they have gone
against orders, expectations, or changed someone's mind. During this
Compulsion, they suffer a -2 to dice all pools.

## Example archetypes

- **Undead Activist** - Death didn't stop this Kindred from fighting for
  their causes, rallying mortals and Kindred alike their aim is to bring
  down structures of power from within.
- **Trolling Punk** - The clan full of its outspoken or physical
  activists still has those who seek the adrenaline of a fight over than
  the cause itself. Picking fights with those weaker than them they seek
  out trouble wherever they can find it. While the rush and payoff from
  the immediate situation is enough, it never lasts and eventually,
  those who wish to stop them will begin to appear.
- **Carthage Denier** - Carthage, myth or not, lives rent-free in this
  Kindred's mind. The idea of a mortal and Kindred utopia is something
  they wish to someday witness. Their connection to the mortal world is
  greater than the average vampire's, working to unify those who they
  can.
- **The Learned One** - Unlike other members of their clan, they prefer
  to devour knowledge rather than crushing skulls. Make no mistake at
  their raw strength, but it's best used when carrying copious amounts
  of dusty tomes and artifacts.

## Culture

### Embraces

The Brujah are a clan usually Embraced from the ranks of revolution,
counterculture, and those that push against the mainstream. Many view
the Brujah as their nickname suggests, Rabble, composed of thugs,
malcontents, and punks. They are a clan known for their ferocity in
battle, but also as critical thinkers. Protestors and activist aren’t
the only people Brujah sires gravitate towards, sociologists, learned
students, those that endured great personal loss, and many more
reasons.[14] Quite a few Brujah choose to mingle with mortals and mortal
society, attempting to guide humans through activist, political
movements, anti-political movements, and the like.[15]  The passion of
the Brujah have another side with Embraces where some sires are careless
with who they choose going off more passion than logic.[16]

### Mortal society

No matter which side of the coin they are Embraced from the passion
their beast gives them is a curse. Their need to rage against something
is in their Blood, some become cruel masters when they lose control, and
keep fighting no matter how many die under their charge. One could say
they are cursed with passion, Many try to channel this rage and passion
in human endeavors to varying degrees of success.[17] The clan is not a
monolith, no clan is, as they are very individualistic with their own
passions, politics, and religions. It is said after 30 or 40 years many
Brujah fail to adapt to new cultures being stuck in an era’s
counterculture. Older Brujah dressed as hippies, goths, aristocrats,
bohemians, etc. are a not an uncommon sight to see. [18]

### Kindred society

Many of the Brujah are viewed only for their might and short temper.
Even when there are those among the clan who are skilled talkers and
cunning organizers. Those that values align with a Brujah’s passion will
find a Kindred allies ready to fight against whatever is ahead of them.
Many Brujah may view their advancement in Kindred affairs linked to
mortal ones. In domains dominated by Brujah, one may expect coup
attempts, revolts, and ideological battles.

The upheaval and challenge to the mainstream is the reason for a rivalry
with the [Ventrue](./ventrue.md)
that is as old as Carthage. The Anarch Movement was one of the few times
a large group of Brujah could act as one, even if not all Brujah shifted
alliances, but most of the clan did welcome some sort of change. From
this the Hellenes generally dislike being seen as traitors by other
Camarilla clans. [19][20]  Though the Kindred may look like loners many
of them see a coterie as not only allies but brother-in-arms and family.
They usually aim to make the coterie cohesive and pull together, even if
their own curse may have at times put them at odds.[21]

### Factional differences

[Anarch](./anarch.md)-aligned
Brujah are given more of a reputation for being fiery and shooting
first. Sometimes they are called *Prometheans*. They don't have as big
an emphasis on clan ties and bloodlines.[22]

[Camarilla](./camarilla.md)-aligned
Brujah are called *Hellenes* and they are reputed to lean more on the
scholarly philosopher-kings types in their clan. They follow the more
traditional conventions of the Camarilla. Some still find decent posts
in cities where enough Hellenes flock.[23]
