From the moment of the
<a href="Embrace" class="wikilink" title="Embrace">Embrace</a>,
<a href="Kindred" class="wikilink" title="Kindred">Kindred</a> gain
access to powers colloquially known as Disciplines. These powers are
developed and fueled by the
[Resonances](./resonance.md)
of the victims they feed from, and allow the vampires to harness their
Blood-borne abilities against others. Vampire
<a href="Clans" class="wikilink" title="Clans">Clans</a> have an
affinity towards specific Disciplines (3 per clan, except for
[thin-blood](./thinblood.md)
and [Caitiff](./caitiff.md)).
Disciplines rate from one to five dots on a scale, each dot allowing
access to one power at the same level or below the current dot value.
For example, a character with two dots of Presence can pick either one
level 1 power and one level 2 power, or two level 1 powers.

A character may gain dots at
<a href="Character_creation" class="wikilink"
title="Character creation">Character creation</a> and later purchase
more using experience points. Typically, a newly created character gains
2 dots in one of their clan Disciplines and 1 in the second one, with an
additional dot acquired via their
<a href="Predator_types" class="wikilink" title="Predator type">Predator
type</a> bonus. In order to level up a Discipline in play, a character
needs to feed from the resonance related to said Discipline. If a player
wants to gain dots in Disciplines their character does not possess (or
is not one of their clan Disciplines), the character must taste the
blood of someone who possesses any powers in said Discipline. [1]

Some Disciplines are heavily guarded by their clans. This may have many
reasons, from the belief that those not of the clan's Blood are not
worthy of such knowledge, or the willingness to offer it only for the
right price. Because of the secrecy of Clan
[Tremere](./tremere.md),
[Blood Sorcery](./blood_sorcery.md) requires a teacher in order to learn it.[2]

The Masquerade is not the only risk with Disciplines either,
<a href="Hunger_system" class="wikilink" title="Hunger">Hunger</a>, is
another that users must consider when utilizing powers. Each turn a
Kindred may activate one power, keep in mind some powers are passive
meaning they are always active. However, others may cost them rouse
checks, stirring their hunger and in turn their Beast. Each strength
comes at a cost, some more than others, and stretching themselves too
thin can bring more chaos than they originally intended.
[Blood Potency](./blood_potency.md) also plays a factor in Disciplines, giving them bonuses or
even allowing reroll on the Rouse Checks as well as
[Intense Temperament](./resonance.md#temperament-and-dyscrasia) from Resonance
adding on an additional bonus. Be aware that if multiple Disciplines
enhance the same roll, then only one of their bonuses may be added.

The use of Disciplines ranges from mental games to physical ability, and
even beyond into magics. Younger Kindred may only have a handful of
powers at their disposal to keep them out of too much trouble, meanwhile
their elders utilize their Disciplines to crush any foe before them.
Still, as powerful as Disciplines may be, they could be the one misstep
needed to bring the [Second Inquisition](./second_inquisition.md) crashing down upon
Kindred. The
<a href="Masquerade" class="wikilink" title="Masquerade">Masquerade</a>
is always present in this game and some powers have more effect than
others. Presence is a power that utilizes mental tricks and manipulation
to control others. The victims are unaware that they are being
controlled and as such the damage to the Masquerade, while present is
smaller. However, powers like Potence where the vampire might punch
cleanly through an opponent's body, or Celerity where they move
inhumanly fast pose a much bigger risk to the Masquerade if witnessed.
In the same way they can be damaging, however, some may save the
Masquerade. For example there is
[Forgetful Mind](./dominate.md#forgetful-mind) which allows altering the
victim's memory and erasing the breach if they are quick enough.
Regardless, older vampires know when and how to use their powers to
minimize the risk.[3]

### Amalgams

Some Discipline powers are available only as **Amalgams**. When a power
has a listed Amalgam, the character must reach a specifically listed
level of another Discipline in order to purchase the current power. If a
player wishes to purchase
[Unliving Hive](./animalism.md#unliving-hive) from the Animalism Discipline,
they must already have two levels of Obfuscate. Because of Amalgams and
natural affinity towards certain Disciplines among vampire clans, some
Discipline powers are less common outside of clans that naturally
possess the relevant Disciplines, such as
[Dementation](./dominate.md#dementation) which is often employed by
[Malkavians](./malkavian.md)
(Dominate + Obfuscate) or [Chimerstry](./obfuscate.md#chimestry) often seen among
[Ravnos](./ravnos.md) (Obfuscate +
Presence).

### Pre-requisites

**Pre-requisites** are another type of Discipline requirement. If a
Discipline power has a pre-requisite, in order to purchase it the player
must already have another power For example, the Obfuscate power
[Vanish](./obfuscate.md#vanish)
requires another Obfuscate power,
[Cloak of Shadows,](./obfuscate.md#cloak-of-shadows) in order to be
obtained.[4]

### Discipline Flaws

While Discipline powers are typically limited to 1 power per dot, the
player may opt to take a
[Discipline Flaw](./merits_flaws.md#ingrained-discipline-flaws) in exchange for additional
powers, up to 3. These flaws have no dot value and has varying
drawbacks. The player must have at least 3 dots in the chosen discipline
to take this flaw, and cannot take more than Flaw. They may also only
take Discipline Flaws from their in-clan Disciplines (except Caitiff),
but this can be waived if the Storyteller deems it appropriate.

## The Disciplines

Disciplines can be learned by any Clan with the exception of
**<a href="Thin-blood_Alchemy" class="wikilink"
title="Thin-blood Alchemy">Thin-blood Alchemy</a>**, which can only be
learned by [thin-bloods](./thinblood.md). However, all Kindred of a
particular Clan are predisposed to certain Clan Disciplines.
