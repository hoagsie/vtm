\_\_TOC\_\_ **Ventrue** are one of the fourteen vampire clans of
Vampire: The Masquerade. The Ventrue are not called the Clan of Kings
for nothing. Carefully choosing their progeny from mortals familiar with
power, wealth, and influence, the Ventrue style themselves the
aristocrats of the vampire world. Their members are expected to assume
command wherever possible, and they’re willing to endure storms for the
sake of leading from the front.[1]

To them, they are the rightful heirs of power and command. The Ventrue
have held more positions of power than any other clan; as god-kings in
ancient Babylon to majority shareholders and campaign fund backers in
the modern age, they've held their footing as long as they could. Though
in recent nights their status has begun to slip, many Ventrue feel their
time is running out and as their privileges slip through their fingers,
most Ventrue tighten their grasp, willing to fight fang and claw to keep
hold.

Clan Ventrue has long been the leader of the
<a href="Camarilla" class="wikilink" title="Camarilla">Camarilla</a>,
even after losing their most prominent representative, Hardestat, to a
Brujah assassination. A majority of the clan believes that the strength
of tradition and lineage is what holds them above the rest. Though these
nights they are careful, blending into humanity behind the scenes.
Resentment is building from having to control the strings from behind
the curtain, but curtailing the
<a href="Masquerade" class="wikilink" title="Masquerade">Masquerade</a>
and possible breaches that would follow should they not is crucial.

Even outside of business they function as if one. They are the
establishment that so many aims to destroy. They set and maintain the
rules, they punish those who do not keep them with the occasional treat
for those who do. Those who do not like their methods call them tyrants
for keeping Kindred down. However, without them, the Camarilla and in
turn, the Masquerade would have fallen long ago.[2]

## Disciplines

Below are the powers innate to the Ventrue as well as the uses they find
in it. [3]

- **Dominate** is used to guide the masses they lead, be it Kindred or
  mortal. It also serves its purpose when hunting to force a mortal to
  show their neck or to protect the Masquerade in a situation gone
  wrong.
- **Fortitude** keeps the Ventrue able to withstand the storms when
  their lesser fight against them. This power has its use for them to
  stand against adversity and feed, where others might struggle with
  blood, they take their fill.
- **Presence** is the alternative to mind control. Used to sway their
  courts and loyal followers to adore them regardless of their less than
  ethical approaches. With their value of conservation, this aids them
  in easily finding prey to take their fill upon.

## Bane

<section begin=bane/>

**Rarefied Tastes** - When the Ventrue drinks the blood of a mortal who
does not fall within their preference, they must spend Willpower equal
to their Bane Severity else they will vomit the blood from their bodies
unable to slake their hunger. Their preferences range within the clan,
some looking for descendants of a certain nationality to soldiers
suffering from PTSD. With a Resolve + Awareness test, they can sense if
a mortal they seek to feed from fits within their preference. At
character creation, their preference should be selected.

<section end=bane/>

[4]

## Variant Bane

<section begin="altbane" />

**Hierarchy** - The Ventrue suffer a penalty equal to their Bane
Severity to their Discipline dice pools when using them against a
vampire of a lower
<a href="generation" class="wikilink" title="generation">generation</a>.
They must also spend
<a href="Willpower" class="wikilink" title="Willpower">Willpower</a>
equal to this penalty if they wish to directly attack other vampires of
a lower generation.

<section end="altbane" />

[5]

## Compulsion

<section begin=compulsion/>

**Arrogance** - Fueled by the beast and their natural desire for power,
the Ventrue must force someone to obey a command given. The order cannot
be given through supernatural means such as
<a href="Dominate" class="wikilink" title="Dominate">Dominate</a>. Until
they satisfy the requirements, they receive a two-dice penalty for any
actions not directly related to leadership.

<section end=compulsion/>

[6]

## Example archetypes

- **Mob Boss** - Through organized crime and manipulation, they've risen
  through the mortal underworld. Some of their clan might turn their
  nose to this path, but this Ventrue knows how to get things done,
  whether blood is spilled or not.
- **Shadow Director** - Hiding in plain sight is the obvious choice, but
  hiding behind the money and business is one way to survive through the
  nights. The Shadow Director controls their business with an iron fist,
  while they remain able to keep from dirtying their hands directly,
  they will rarely take the ethical choice when power is on the table.
- **Politician** - The Clan of Kings have always viewed power as the way
  to maintain the status quo. Using mortal laws to sway the shape of
  their city, they use their status to sway the politicians in their
  party and in turn the reporters to cover the Masquerade.
- **Aspiring Childe** - Not all Ventrue have reached the lofty
  expectation set for them, many Ventrue are small timers, looking to
  use their skills to build a business empire in the next twenty years.

**Hardestadt** - The name of a sire and childe. Hardestadt the Elder met
<a href="Final_death" class="wikilink" title="Final Death">Final
Death</a> at the hands of the Brujah,
<a href="Brujah" class="wikilink" title="Tyler">Tyler</a>. This left
Hardestadt the Younger room to run the Camarilla with the foundation his
sire laid while impersonating him. Until his destruction at the hands of
Brujah rebels lead by
<a href="Brujah#Notable_Characters" class="wikilink"
title="Theo Bell">Theo Bell</a> during the Convention of Prague in 2012,
he was the most important Ventrue for eight centuries. He, alongside six
others, was a founder of the Camarilla. Hardestadt did not
<a href="Embrace" class="wikilink" title="Embrace">Embrace</a> many
mortals and never confirmed his lineage to a Fourth
<a href="Generation" class="wikilink" title="Generation">Generation</a>
methuselah. None who have come before or after could stand to the power
and influence he held and as far as he was concerned he was the be-all
end-all of the clan.[7]

**Fiorenza Savona** - With her global political control she managed to
keep the clan relevant and dangerous as the center of global power.
Fiorenza worked has as a mortal and continues to do so in her unlife to
secure that wealthy and powerful vampires remain in power.[8]

**Lodin** - Once Prince of Chicago he systematically eradicated anyone
who challenged his claim of the throne. He ruthlessness destroyed anyone
in his path, including his own clan who was viewed as a primary threat
rather than allies. He's gone in the modern nights but his legacy lives
on in his bloodline.[9]

**Horatio Ballard** - Business mogul with millions from his investments,
banks, real estate, and construction companies collectively known as
Ballard Industries. A childe of Lodin with a large sum of wealth and
political power which he used to support his sire’s rule. After Lodin’s
supposed death, he backed Kevin Jackson’s bid for Prince in
<a href="Chicago,_Illinois" class="wikilink" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>.
The crash of the housing market didn’t hurt his companies due to keen
business acumen, but his personal wealth and reputation took a massive
hit. This leaves the Ventrue ready for an ambitious rebuilding
effort.[10]

**Lucinde** - A prominent member of clan Ventrue and current Justicar,
reaching many ranks in the Camarilla. She first worked as an Archons and
later an Alastor the first of its kind. Alastor is a role where she
hunts down the Camarilla's most dangerous and most wanted on the "Red
List". The role is also tasked with hunting down illegal
<a href="Diablerie" class="wikilink" title="diablerists">diablerists</a>.
She specializes in deep undercover investigations and biding her time to
strike her enemies. Her background has allowed her to raise to the role
of Justicar and be named Justicar for life. Her Archons often work out
of Chicago conducting investigations.[11]

## Culture

### Embrace

Ventrue are typically very selective in their
<a href="Embrace" class="wikilink" title="Embraces">Embraces</a>, as
they see lineage and traditions to be of the utmost importance. The
Embrace is an important ritual for the Blueblood for the aforementioned
reasons, going so far as the selection impacting the sire’s standing in
the clan. The usual stock of Ventrue childers come from overachievers,
powerful Kindred be it financially or politically, and those with
talents that puts them above others in the world. Childers are usually
taught to admire their vampiric lineage and the importance of the clan.
When they greet each other they not only say their sire, grand sire,
great grand sire, etc. but also their ancestors' feats. Many of the sire
put their new charges through tests to make sure they are worthy of Clan
of Kings; the clan is not known to tolerate failure.[12][13][14]

### Mortal society

Pioneers in terms of power and wealth, having well placed pawns in
politics, finance, and exclusive clubs. Most Ventrue are no longer able
to lead the human world like they did in nights of old. Many shy from
being, leader of the board, or open heads of their community. For safety
reasons many have begrudgingly taken to influence from the shadows. They
take on the role of bankers, silent partners, shadow directors, and
reclusive CEOs. Though not all Ventrue takes this warning, some still
openly lead unbothered by the changing times. They all know a breach is
a troubling thing to have to bear.

When it comes to being around mortals the Ventrue keep a formality about
themselves; meeting in private booths or across boardroom tables. Some
go as far as to own their kine, shaping them to fit their needs and
keeping them on the leash through wage slavery or keeping them in the
Blood Bond. Mortals who don’t have use or sentiment to Tyrants, are
often ignored, for the Kindred knows they are better than them. The
mortals who do fall under the Ventrue leadership are usually infected
with this arrogance and distaste for other mortals who mean little to
them.[15][16]

The clan is among the best customers of the
<a href="Circulatory_System" class="wikilink"
title="Circulatory System">Circulatory System</a>. Their bane has made
them need to look carefully at their victims. Sometimes the Childe and
Sire share the same restriction or the restriction is linked to a
Ventrue’s past. They can be all over the place factoring in employment,
gender, place of birth, blood quality, or even events in the victims
life. Examples are Kevin Jackson only feeding on gang members while
Hardestadt could only feed on those with military experience. The
Ventrue will do anything to get the blood they desire, even if they need
to manipulate and corral their palates. Cultivate board members, groups,
or entourages so they always can feed is never below the Blue
Bloods.[17][18]

### Kindred society

To many Ventrue without them there is no
<a href="Camarilla" class="wikilink" title="Camarilla">Camarilla</a>.
They see themselves as the leaders of the Kindred and it is not just a
notion to them, but their destiny. To them no other clan has the wisdom,
restraint, control, and lineage to take on such a mantle. The Ventrue
also know they have some of the most influence in the sect and even with
the exodus of the
<a href="Brujah" class="wikilink" title="Brujah">Brujah</a> and the
incoming of the
<a href="Lasombra" class="wikilink" title="Lasombra">Lasombra</a> and
the
<a href="Banu_Haqim" class="wikilink" title="Banu Haqim">Banu Haqim</a>.
The group of self-interested motivated Kindred are said to be the
wealthiest Kindred. They don’t share their wealth freely, but put it to
use to buy influence, quiet opponents, gain followers, and live the high
life.[19][20]

The clan itself looks at the lineage and the human societies they have
influenced: Sparta, Rome, Francia, old Italia, and the British Empire.
The feats of their past influence their future. They are confident they
are a cut above the Kindred of the night.[21] No matter the sect or
faction, something the Ventrue usually strive for is expanding their
power, finding new connections and making themselves ideal allies. While
the Blue Bloods may view other lowly Kindred as obstacles or rivals,
those who are allies often benefit from the proximity to power. Their
allies benefit from the open doors the Blue Blood offers and the Ventrue
in turns benefits from their allies falling in line under them.[22]

#### The Directorate

The Ventrue have an inner body of elders and high ranking members called
the Directorate. They watch over clan affairs and even instruct high
profile Blue Bloods; the Directorate tapped Kevin Jackson to introduce
the <a href="Lasombra" class="wikilink" title="Lasombra">Lasombra</a>
into the
<a href="Chicago,_Illinois" class="wikilink" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>
Camarilla and they have a wary eye on Fiorenza Savona’s rapid growing
success. Little is known of them and it is said to be one of many
shadowy inner clan councils similar to the
<a href="Lasombra" class="wikilink"
title="Lasombra&#39;s">Lasombra's</a> Amici Noctis.[23][24][25]

### Factional differences

The Ventrue seem themselves as the embodiment of the Camarilla and the
ones destined to lead Kindred. Camarilla Ventrue hold the most
Princedoms of any clan. The are strong enforcers of the Traditions and
believe in legacy. Their strong views on legacy shape the Camarilla
Ventrue, they judge each other on who they Embrace. Their sires teach
their vampiric lineage with great tutelage to their childers. When they
greet each other they not only say their sire, grand sire, great grand
sire, etc. but also their ancestors' feats. They call Ventrue who break
away from the Tower Caitiff, as an insult. Some Princes go as far as to
call a blood hunt on such Ventrue.[26][27][28]

Anarch Ventrue call themselves *Free* Ventrue. They call themselves free
from worshiping and adhering to Ventrue of their line, free from giving
reverence to Princes because they are of the clan, and free from the
yoke of their sire. They despise everything based on bloodlines and age
for the Camarilla Ventrue. In the Anarch Movement they have done well
with their limited numbers with many becoming Barons, enforcers, and
sweepers. Though they aren’t fully trusted in the Anarch Movement, many
use their leadership skills to lead Anarch war parties against the
faction’s enemies or grind a kine’s will into growing its powerbase.[29]
