## Prominent locations

### Elysia

#### Laws of Chicago Elysia

These laws were originally introduced by former Prince Lodin; they have
been reinstated under Prince Jackson and the Primogen. [68]

1.  On pain of a Blood Hunt, no violence is permitted on the premises
    against Kindred, kine, or property.
2.  The Elysium is to be considered neutral ground. No conflict of any
    sort among Kindred may be carried onto its sacred ground.
3.  Access shall not be limited; all Cainites are welcome.
4.  One should not attract attention as one leaves and enters Elysium.

#### Garfield Park Conservatory

It was declared Elysium during Lodin’s reign. Primogen Rosa and the
Gangrel ensure the conservatory is well funded. The surrounding area has
done well as well. The conservatory gets much praise, but makes the
Toreador jealous. [69]

#### Neo-Futurist Theater

A non profit community theater with late-night showings, yet has
cutting-edge acting and theater work for a small black box theater. This
theater is a crown jewel of Clan Toreador and recognized as official
Elysium in 2015. [70]

#### Resurrection Cemetery Mausoleum

Technically outside the city limits of Chicago, this area was sanctioned
as Elysium during the short Peterson Princedom. Many Kine know this
location for the Resurrection Mary ghost story involving a missing girl.
It has three floors and is made of beautiful white stone. It was crafted
in the 1960s in a joint effort between the
[Hecata](./hecata.md),
[Ministry](./ministry.md),
and Camarilla for a defense against the
[Sabbat](./sabbat.md). [71]

### Other Places Declared Elysium

- Chicago City Ballet
- The Linda Enfield Art Gallery
- The Chicago Central Library
- The Art Museum of Chicago
- The Smart Gallery
- The Chicago Opera Theater
- Orchestra Hall
- The Arie Crown Theater
- The Civic Theater. [72]

### Midway Airport

The smaller Chicago Airport and the only other in the city. It is
considered an Elysium and neutral ground. Though many don’t dare go to
this location as the Lupine securely hold on to the airport.

### Blue Velvet Club

A popular bar nestled in the Rack that attracts Kindred and kine alike.
It is one of the hot spots for Kindred to socialize. Blue Velvet’s
amenities include a dancefloor, multiple bars, and a VIP lounge. Kindred
wanting to enter this club must be on the list. Lucky Kindred may be
invited to one of the private tastings facilitated by the stored herds
of humans in the cellar. [73][74]

### The Rack

The most prominent feeding locations that are declared open to all
kindred who can keep the masquerade and use discretion. Neighborhoods
include Wicker Park, Wrigleyville, and Boystown. [75]

### The Succubus Club

A Kindred owned bar with dance floors, bars, stage, balconies, and
private VIP suites. It also contains a spa, galleries, and a whisky
lounge. A club filled with nostalgia that attracts members of any sect
for meetings. [76]

### Red No 5

Owned by Caitiff Bennett Steadman, he keeps the club with an air of
exclusivity. Usually having his bouncer field out whoever doesn’t fit
the vibe of night. It has a sitting area, dance floor, and a VIP section
with a variety of music. It has proven very popular with outsiders.
[77][78]

### Chinatown

Technically controlled by the
[Tremere](./tremere.md), but the
chantry stays away. After a series of unexplainable mystical events and
investigates by the blood mages. Usually avoided by kindred, but there
are rumors of a cult called Xūmigōngpai (“Abyssal Labyrinth School”),
that victimized the community and unfriendly to outsiders. [79]

### The Collar

The Collar denotes various suburbs and city centers around Chicago open
for claiming; territories for those willing to take the risk. They are
potential places for Baronies or Praxes to be declared or gifted,
respectively. As Brujah, Joshua Tarnopolski, sets eyes on a Barony of
Joliet and Naperville. The Camarilla purposefully squeezed the Anarchs
out of the city proper. If Prince Jackson has his way the more prime
territories will be bargaining chips for others that do his bidding
further pushing the Anarchs out. The Camarilla Prince finding the
territory overall a logistical nightmare to manage, is in need of
delegation. These areas are dangerous: unaligned kindred,
[Church of Caine](./church_caine.md),
[Bahari](./bahari.md), Lupines,
and low density hunting grounds. The major Collar cities considered are
Oakland Park, Wheaton, Joliet, Naperville, Schaumburg and sometimes
[Gary, Indiana](./gary_in.md). [80][81]

## Important events

Originally the land of the Algonquian people, a
[Brujah](./brujah.md) Methuselah
lived among them,
<a href="Menele" class="wikilink" title="Meneleaus">Meneleaus</a>. When
the French and
[Toreador](./toreador.md)
Methuselah, <a href="Helena" class="wikilink" title="Helena">Helena</a>,
arrived they fought manipulating their humans. Fort Dearborn was
eventually set up and it grew into the city of Chicago in 1833. Their
rivalry turned to manipulating Kine and Kindred in Chicago until
<a href="Menelaus" class="wikilink" title="Menelaus">Menelaus</a> gave
in to the
[Beckoning](./beckoning.md).
[82]

Chicago’s first Prince was Maxwell of clan
[Brujah](./brujah.md). He served
until his usurpation during the Great Chicago Fire in 1871. Maxwell's
former subordinate, Lodin of Clan
[Ventrue](./ventrue.md), took the
throne during the crisis and would rule the city for decades to come.
His power was tempered by the city’s politically powerful Primogen. His
frustration saw him focus on warring with
<a href="Modius" class="wikilink" title="Modius">Modius</a>, a failed
usurper and Prince of
[Gary](./gary_in.md). [83]

Lodin’s rule was challenged by Maldavis, in what is known as the
Councils Wars in the early 1980s. The city’s political deadlock mirrored
the kindred Primogen council. Select Primogen support Maldavis’ Anarch
rebellion and other support Lodin. Lodin for the first time in years
felt challenged. Every plan and strategy he had was disrupted by her,
defeat loomed. It was only until he capitulated to the demands of the
Primogen that the Primogen gave him the support he needed to finally
regain control and deliver a massive blow to the
[Anarchs](./anarch.md) in the
late 1980s. [84]

The Great Chicago Flood displaces most of the
[Nosferatu](./nosferatu.md),
many blame the
[Tremere](./tremere.md) but
motives are unknown. In 1993, the War of Chicago commenced where
<a href="Lupine" class="wikilink" title="Lupine">Lupine</a> packs and
the [Sabbat](./sabbat.md) attacked
Chicago, shaking up the domain with many slain. The most prominent of
which being Prince Lodin's supposed death. For nearly two decades, the
throne of Prince remains empty and is run by the Primogen Council.
[85][86][87]

The Tremere were dealt a blow when the fall of Vienna took their former
regent; losing their Primogen Council seat and their status as a
represented clan in Chicago took a hit. They are largely apolitical for
now. [88][89]

Lodin’s childe, Joseph Peterson, attempted to declare Praxis on the
city. He made investments and sought support, and tied legitimacy of his
claim to the Chicago bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics, that was
submitted in 2007. When the city was passed over in the first round in
2009, this spelled disaster for his “paper Praxis” earning him debt,
embarrassment, and eventual exile. [90]

Lodin’s other childe,
<a href="Kevin_Jackson" class="wikilink" title="Kevin Jackson">Kevin
Jackson</a>, stepped up to make a claim and solidify his own praxis in
2010. He works on establishing his rule first by making peace with the
Lupine. [91] His other move was facilitating the Convention of Chicago,
a large gathering of Camarilla Princes, Primogens, and diplomats. The
event was a success to the Kindred public, while organizers know how
close it was to a disaster with Anarchs plots, and sect intrigue gone
wild. [92] The next was establishing “finishing schools” to teach young
kindred or captured Anarch Ventrue. Supposed to be a way to educate
dissidents back to the fold via threats and blood bonds. Related he has
called a blood hunt on all Illinois Anarch Ventrue, those captured alive
are taken to his school. [93][94][95][96]

His other initiatives are pushing the
[Anarchs](./anarch.md) to the
outskirts of the city and edges of the suburb. His new rule of only
allowing 10 Anarchs in the city has proven a useful tool to divide and
conquer. [97][98][99] He is following the Directorate’s orders by
facilitating the
[Lasombra](./lasombra.md)
defection into a Camarilla Chicago. [100][101][102][103][104]
